"Despite being very generic, TableGen has some deficiencies that have been"
" pointed out numerous times. The common theme is that, while TableGen "
"allows you to build Domain-Specific-Languages, the final languages that "
"you create lack the power of other DSLs, which in turn increase "
"considerably the size and complexity of TableGen files."

"At the same time, TableGen allows you to create virtually any meaning of "
"the basic concepts via custom-made back-ends, which can pervert the "
"original design and make it very hard for newcomers to understand it."

"There are some in favour of extending the semantics even more, but making"
" sure back-ends adhere to strict rules. Others suggesting we should move "
"to more powerful DSLs designed with specific purposes, or even re-using "
"existing DSLs."

"TODO: Add here frequently asked questions about why TableGen doesn't do "
"what you want, how it might, and how we could extend/restrict it to be "
"more use friendly."
