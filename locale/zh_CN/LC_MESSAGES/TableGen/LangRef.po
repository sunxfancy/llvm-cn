"This document is meant to be a normative spec about the TableGen language"

"The lexical and syntax notation used here is intended to imitate "
"`Python's`_. In particular, for lexical definitions, the productions "
"operate at the character level and there is no implied whitespace between"
" elements. The syntax definitions operate at the token level, so there is"
" implied whitespace between tokens."
