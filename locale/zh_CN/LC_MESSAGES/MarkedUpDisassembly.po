msgid ""
"LLVM's default disassembly output is raw text. To allow consumers more "
"ability to introspect the instructions' textual representation or to "
"reformat for a more user friendly display there is an optional rich "
"disassembly output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:15
msgid ""
"This optional output is sufficient to reference into individual portions "
"of the instruction text. This is intended for clients like disassemblers,"
" list file generators, and pretty-printers, which need more than the raw "
"instructions and the ability to print them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:20
msgid ""
"To provide this functionality the assembly text is marked up with "
"annotations. The markup is simple enough in syntax to be robust even in "
"the case of version mismatches between consumers and producers. That is, "
"the syntax generally does not carry semantics beyond \"this text has an "
"annotation,\" so consumers can simply ignore annotations they do not "
"understand or do not care about."

"After calling ``LLVMCreateDisasm()`` to create a disassembler context the"
" optional output is enable with this call:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:33
msgid ""
"Then subsequent calls to ``LLVMDisasmInstruction()`` will return output "
"strings with the marked up annotations."

msgid "Contextual markups"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:44
msgid ""
"Annoated assembly display will supply contextual markup to help clients "
"more efficiently implement things like pretty printers. Most markup will "
"be target independent, so clients can effectively provide good display "
"without any target specific knowledge."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:49
msgid ""
"Annotated assembly goes through the normal instruction printer, but "
"optionally includes contextual tags on portions of the instruction "
"string. An annotation is any '<' '>' delimited section of text(1)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:59
msgid ""
"The tag-name is an identifier which gives the type of the annotation. For"
" the first pass, this will be very simple, with memory references, "
"registers, and immediates having the tag names \"mem\", \"reg\", and "
"\"imm\", respectively."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:63
msgid ""
"The tag-modifier-list is typically additional target-specific context, "
"such as register class."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:66
msgid ""
"Clients should accept and ignore any tag-names or tag-modifiers they do "
"not understand, allowing the annotations to grow in richness without "
"breaking older clients."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:70
msgid ""
"For example, a possible annotation of an ARM load of a stack-relative "
"location might be annotated as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:78
msgid ""
"1: For assembly dialects in which '<' and/or '>' are legal tokens, a "
"literal token is escaped by following immediately with a repeat of the "
"character.  For example, a literal '<' character is output as '<<' in an "
"annotated assembly string."

#: ../../MarkedUpDisassembly.rst:83
msgid ""
"The intended consumers of this information use the C API, therefore the "
"new C API function for the disassembler will be added to provide an "
"option to produce disassembled instructions with annotations, "
"``LLVMSetDisasmOptions()`` and the ``LLVMDisassembler_Option_UseMarkup`` "
"option (see above)."
