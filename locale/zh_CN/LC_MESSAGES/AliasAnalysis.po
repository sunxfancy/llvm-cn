"Alias Analysis (aka Pointer Analysis) is a class of techniques which "
"attempt to determine whether or not two pointers ever can point to the "
"same object in memory.  There are many different algorithms for alias "
"analysis and many different ways of classifying them: flow-sensitive vs. "
"flow-insensitive, context-sensitive vs. context-insensitive, field-"
"sensitive vs. field-insensitive, unification-based vs. subset-based, etc."
"  Traditionally, alias analyses respond to a query with a `Must, May, or "
"No`_ alias response, indicating that two pointers always point to the "
"same object, might point to the same object, or are known to never point "
"to the same object."

"of alias analysis information and the implementations providing it, and "
"is designed to support a wide range of implementations and clients (but "
"currently all clients are assumed to be flow-insensitive).  In addition "
