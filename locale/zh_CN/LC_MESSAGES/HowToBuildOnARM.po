"Here are some notes on building/testing LLVM/Clang on ARM. Note that ARM "
"encompasses a wide variety of CPUs; this advice is primarily based on the"
" ARMv6 and ARMv7 architectures and may be inapplicable to older chips."

"The most popular Linaro/Ubuntu OS's for ARM boards, e.g., the Pandaboard,"
" have become hard-float platforms. There are a number of choices when "
"using CMake. Autoconf usage is deprecated as of 3.8."

"Building LLVM/Clang in ``Relese`` mode is preferred since it consumes a "
"lot less memory. Otherwise, the building process will very likely fail "
"due to insufficient memory. It's also a lot quicker to only build the "
"relevant back-ends (ARM and AArch64), since it's very unlikely that "
"you'll use an ARM board to cross-compile to other arches. If you're "
"running Compiler-RT tests, also include the x86 back-end, or some tests "
"will fail."

"After that, just typing ``make -jN`` or ``ninja`` will build everything. "
"``make -jN check-all`` or ``ninja check-all`` will run all compiler "
"tests. For running the test suite, please refer to :doc:`TestingGuide`."

"If you are building LLVM/Clang on an ARM board with 1G of memory or less,"
" please use ``gold`` rather then GNU ``ld``. In any case it is probably a"
" good idea to set up a swap partition, too."

"ARM development boards can be unstable and you may experience that cores "
"are disappearing, caches being flushed on every big.LITTLE switch, and "
"other similar issues.  To help ease the effect of this, set the Linux "
"scheduler to \"performance\" on **all** cores using this little script:"

"Remember to turn that off after the build, or you may risk burning your "
"CPU. Most modern kernels don't need that, so only use it if you have "

"Running the build on SD cards is ok, but they are more prone to failures "
"than good quality USB sticks, and those are more prone to failures than "
"external hard-drives (those are also a lot faster). So, at least, you "
"should consider to buy a fast USB stick.  On systems with a fast eMMC, "
"that's a good option too."

"Make sure you have a decent power supply (dozens of dollars worth) that "
"can provide *at least* 4 amperes, this is especially important if you use"
" USB devices with your board. Externally powered USB/SATA harddrives are "
"even better than having a good power supply."
