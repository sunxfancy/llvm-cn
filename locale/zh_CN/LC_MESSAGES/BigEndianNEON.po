"Generating code for big endian ARM processors is for the most part "

"In this document the term \"vector\" refers to what the ARM ABI calls a "
"\"short vector\", which is a sequence of items that can fit in a NEON "
"register. This sequence can be 64 or 128 bits in length, and can "
"constitute 8, 16, 32 or 64 bit items. This document refers to A64 "
"instructions throughout, but is almost applicable to the A32/ARMv7 "
"instruction sets also. The ABI format for passing vectors in A32 is "
"sligtly different to A64. Apart from that, the same concepts apply."

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:46
msgid ""
"The main problem is how vectors are represented in memory and in "
"registers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:48
msgid ""
"First, a recap. The \"endianness\" of an item affects its representation "
"in memory only. In a register, a number is just a sequence of bits - 64 "
"bits in the case of AArch64 general purpose registers. Memory, however, "
"is a sequence of addressable units of 8 bits in size. Any number greater "
"than 8 bits must therefore be split up into 8-bit chunks, and endianness "
"describes the order in which these chunks are laid out in memory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:50
msgid ""
"A \"little endian\" layout has the least significant byte first (lowest "
"in memory address). A \"big endian\" layout has the *most* significant "
"byte first. This means that when loading an item from big endian memory, "
"the lowest 8-bits in memory must go in the most significant 8-bits, and "
"so forth."

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:61
msgid ""
"A vector is a consecutive sequence of items that are operated on "
"simultaneously. To load a 64-bit vector, 64 bits need to be read from "
"memory. In little endian mode, we can do this by just performing a 64-bit"
" load - ``LDR q0, [foo]``. However if we try this in big endian mode, "
"because of the byte swapping the lane indices end up being swapped! The "
"zero'th item as laid out in memory becomes the n'th lane in the vector."

"Big endian vector load using ``LD1``. Note that the lanes retain the "
"correct ordering."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:69
msgid ""
"Because of this, the instruction ``LD1`` performs a vector load but "
"performs byte swapping not on the entire 64 bits, but on the individual "
"items within the vector. This means that the register content is the same"
" as it would have been on a little endian system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:71
msgid ""
"It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to peform vector loads on a big "
"endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches "

"The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded "

msgstr ""

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:78
msgid ""
"Because ``LD1 == LDR + REV`` and similarly ``LDR == LD1 + REV`` (on a big"
" endian system), we can simulate either type of load with the other type "
"of load plus a ``REV`` instruction. So we're not deciding which "
"instructions to use, but which format to use (which will then influence "
"which instruction is best to use)."

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:93
msgid ""
"LLVM IR has first class vector types. In LLVM IR, the zero'th element of "
"a vector resides at the lowest memory address. The optimizer relies on "
"this property in certain areas, for example when concatenating vectors "
"together. The intention is for arrays and vectors to have identical "
"memory layouts - ``[4 x i8]`` and ``<4 x i8>`` should be represented the "
"same in memory. Without this property there would be many special cases "
"that the optimizer would have to cleverly handle."

"Use of ``LDR`` would break this lane ordering property. This doesn't "

"When a short vector is transferred between registers and memory it is "
"treated as an opaque object. That is a short vector is stored in memory "
"as if it were stored with a single ``STR`` of the entire register; a "
"short vector is loaded from memory using the corresponding ``LDR`` "
"instruction. On a little-endian system this means that element 0 will "

msgid ""
"The use of ``LDR`` and ``STR`` as the ABI defines has at least one "
"advantage over ``LD1`` and ``ST1``. ``LDR`` and ``STR`` are oblivious to "
"the size of the individual lanes of a vector. ``LD1`` and ``ST1`` are not"
" - the lane size is encoded within them. This is important across an ABI "
"boundary, because it would become necessary to know the lane width the "
"callee expects. Consider the following code:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:124
msgid ""
"If ``callee`` changed its signature to ``uint16x4_t``, which is "
"equivalent in register content, if we passed as ``LD1`` we'd break this "
"code until ``caller`` was updated and recompiled."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:126
msgid ""
"There is an argument that if the signatures of the two functions are "
"different then the behaviour should be undefined. But there may be "
"functions that are agnostic to the lane layout of the vector, and "
"treating the vector as an opaque value (just loading it and storing it) "
"would be impossible without a common format across ABI boundaries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:128
msgid ""
"So to preserve ABI compatibility, we need to use the ``LDR`` lane layout "
"across function calls."

msgid "Alignment"
msgstr ""

#: ../../BigEndianNEON.rst:133
msgid ""
"In strict alignment mode, ``LDR qX`` requires its address to be 128-bit "
"aligned, whereas ``LD1`` only requires it to be as aligned as the lane "
"size. If we canonicalised on using ``LDR``, we'd still need to use "
"``LD1`` in some places to avoid alignment faults (the result of the "
"``LD1`` would then need to be reversed with ``REV``)."

"Neither approach is perfect, and choosing one boils down to choosing the "
"lesser of two evils. The issue with lane ordering, it was decided, would "
"have to change target-agnostic compiler passes and would result in a "
"strange IR in which lane indices were reversed. It was decided that this "
"was worse than the changes that would have to be made to support ``LD1``,"

"The main problem with the ``LD1`` solution is dealing with bitconverts "

"only change the compiler's interpretation of data, not the underlying "
"data itself. A requirement is that if data is loaded and then saved again"
" (called a \"round trip\"), the memory contents should be the same after "
"the store as before the load. If a vector is loaded and is then "
"bitconverted to a different vector type before storing, the round trip "

"One lane vectors may seem useless as a concept but they serve to "
