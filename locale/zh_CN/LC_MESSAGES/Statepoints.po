"LLVM currently supports an alternate mechanism for conservative garbage "
"collection support using the ``gcroot`` intrinsic.  The mechanism "

#: ../../Statepoints.rst:25
msgid ""
"To collect dead objects, garbage collectors must be able to identify any "
"references to objects contained within executing code, and, depending on "
"the collector, potentially update them.  The collector does not need this"
" information at all points in code - that would make the problem much "
"harder - but only at well-defined points in the execution known as "
"'safepoints' For most collectors, it is sufficient to track at least one "
"copy of each unique pointer value.  However, for a collector which wishes"
" to relocate objects directly reachable from running code, a higher "
"standard is required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Statepoints.rst:35
msgid ""
"One additional challenge is that the compiler may compute intermediate "
"results (\"derived pointers\") which point outside of the allocation or "
"even into the middle of another allocation.  The eventual use of this "
"intermediate value must yield an address within the bounds of the "
"allocation, but such \"exterior derived pointers\" may be visible to the "
"collector.  Given this, a garbage collector can not safely rely on the "
"runtime value of an address to indicate the object it is associated with."
"  If the garbage collector wishes to move any object, the compiler must "
"provide a mapping, for each pointer, to an indication of its allocation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Statepoints.rst:46
msgid ""
"To simplify the interaction between a collector and the compiled code, "
"most garbage collectors are organized in terms of three abstractions: "
"load barriers, store barriers, and safepoints."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Statepoints.rst:50
msgid ""
"A load barrier is a bit of code executed immediately after the machine "
"load instruction, but before any use of the value loaded. Depending on "
"the collector, such a barrier may be needed for all loads, merely loads "
"of a particular type (in the original source language), or none at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Statepoints.rst:56
msgid ""
"Analogously, a store barrier is a code fragment that runs immediately "
"before the machine store instruction, but after the computation of the "
"value stored.  The most common use of a store barrier is to update a "
"'card table' in a generational garbage collector."

"A safepoint is a location at which pointers visible to the compiled code "
"(i.e. currently in registers or on the stack) are allowed to change.  "
"After the safepoint completes, the actual pointer value may differ, but "
"the 'object' (as seen by the source language) pointed to will not."

"Note that the term 'safepoint' is somewhat overloaded.  It refers to both"

"used in this document refers exclusively to the former."

"This document focuses on the last item - compiler support for safepoints "

"At the most abstract level, inserting a safepoint can be thought of as "

"In this example, we need to relocate the SSA value ``%obj``.  Since we "

#: ../../Statepoints.rst:156

"Instead, the statepoint intrinsic marks the actual site of the safepoint "
