"Due to Clang's influence (mostly the fact that parsing and semantic "
"analysis are so intertwined for C and especially C++), the typical "
"working definition of AST in the LLVM community is roughly \"the "
"compiler's first complete symbolic (as opposed to textual) representation"
" of an input program\". As such, an \"AST\" might be a more general graph"
" instead of a \"tree\" (consider the symbolic representation for the type"
" of a typical \"linked list node\"). This working definition is closer to"
" what some authors call an \"annotated abstract syntax tree\"."
