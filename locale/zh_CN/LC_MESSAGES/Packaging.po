"LLVM sets certain default configure options to make sure our developers "
"don't break things for constrained platforms.  These settings are not "
"optimal for most desktop systems, and we hope that packagers (e.g., "
"Redhat, Debian, MacPorts, etc.) will tweak them.  This document lists "
"settings we suggest you tweak."

"LLVM's API changes with each release, so users are likely to want, for "

"LLVM runs much more quickly when it's optimized and assertions are "
"removed. However, such a build is currently incompatible with users who "
"build without defining ``NDEBUG``, and the lack of assertions makes it "
"hard to debug problems in user code.  We recommend allowing users to "
"install both optimized and debug versions of LLVM in parallel.  The "
"following configure flags are relevant:"

"Builds LLVM with ``NDEBUG`` defined.  Changes the LLVM ABI.  Also "
"available by setting ``DISABLE_ASSERTIONS=0|1`` in ``make``'s "

"setting, but it slows things down."
