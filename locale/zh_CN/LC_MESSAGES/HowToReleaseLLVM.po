"LLVM is released on a time based schedule --- with major releases roughly"
" every 6 months.  In between major releases there may be dot releases. "
"The release manager will determine if and when to make a dot release "
"based on feedback from the community.  Typically, dot releases should be "
"made if there are large number of bug-fixes in the stable branch or a "
"critical bug has been discovered that affects a large number of users."

"Send out release candidate sources for first round of testing.  Testing "
