"Basically you have to do two things at a minimum.  First, decide whether "
"the bug `crashes the compiler`_ (or an LLVM pass), or if the compiler is "
"`miscompiling`_ the program (i.e., the compiler successfully produces an "
"executable, but it doesn't run right). Based on what type of bug it is, "
"follow the instructions in the linked section to narrow down the bug so "
"that the person who fixes it will be able to find the problem more "
"easily."

"More often than not, bugs in the compiler cause it to crash---often due "
"to an assertion failure of some sort. The most important piece of the "
"puzzle is to figure out if it is crashing in the GCC front-end or if it "
"is one of the LLVM libraries (e.g. the optimizer or code generator) that "
"has problems."

"To figure out which component is crashing (the front-end, optimizer or "
"code generator), run the ``clang`` command line as you were when the "
"crash occurred, but with the following extra command line options:"

msgid ""
"``-O0 -emit-llvm``: If ``clang`` still crashes when passed these options "

"(containing preprocessed C source code) and possibly ``foo.s`` for each "

"Similarly to debugging incorrect compilation by mis-behaving passes, you "

"narrow the code down to a function that is miscompiled by one or the "
"other method, but since for correctness, the entire program must be run, "
"``bugpoint`` will compile the code it deems to not be affected with the C"
