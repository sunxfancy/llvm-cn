"The LLVM build system is designed to facilitate the building of third "
"party projects that use LLVM header files, libraries, and tools.  In "
"order to use these facilities, a ``Makefile`` from a project must do the "
"following things:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:15
msgid ""
"Set ``make`` variables. There are several variables that a ``Makefile`` "
"needs to set to use the LLVM build system:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:18
msgid "``PROJECT_NAME`` - The name by which your project is known."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:19
msgid "``LLVM_SRC_ROOT`` - The root of the LLVM source tree."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:23
msgid "``PROJ_INSTALL_ROOT`` - The root installation directory."

"``LEVEL`` - The relative path from the current directory to the project's"

msgid "There are two ways that you can set all of these variables:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:33
msgid "You can write your own ``Makefiles`` which hard-code these values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:35
msgid ""
"You can use the pre-made LLVM sample project. This sample project "
"includes ``Makefiles``, a configure script that can be used to configure "
"the location of LLVM, and the ability to support multiple object "
"directories from a single source directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:40
msgid ""
"If you want to devise your own build system, studying other projects and "
"LLVM ``Makefiles`` will probably provide enough information on how to "
"write your own ``Makefiles``."

msgid "Source Tree Layout"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:47
msgid ""
"In order to use the LLVM build system, you will want to organize your "
"source code so that it can benefit from the build system's features.  "
"Mainly, you want your source tree layout to look similar to the LLVM "
"source tree layout."
msgstr ""

"Underneath your top level directory, you should have the following "
"directories:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:53
msgid "**lib**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:55
msgid ""
"This subdirectory should contain all of your library source code.  For "
"each library that you build, you will have one directory in **lib** that "
"will contain that library's source code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:59
msgid ""
"Libraries can be object files, archives, or dynamic libraries.  The "
"**lib** directory is just a convenient place for libraries as it places "
"them all in a directory from which they can be linked later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:63
msgid "**include**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:65
msgid ""
"This subdirectory should contain any header files that are global to your"
" project. By global, we mean that they are used by more than one library "
"or executable of your project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:69
msgid ""
"By placing your header files in **include**, they will be found "
"automatically by the LLVM build system.  For example, if you have a file "
"**include/jazz/note.h**, then your source files can include it simply "
"with **#include \"jazz/note.h\"**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:74
msgid "**tools**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:76
msgid ""
"This subdirectory should contain all of your source code for executables."
" For each program that you build, you will have one directory in "
"**tools** that will contain that program's source code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:80
msgid "**test**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:82
msgid ""
"This subdirectory should contain tests that verify that your code works "
"correctly.  Automated tests are especially useful."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:85
msgid ""
"Currently, the LLVM build system provides basic support for tests. The "
"LLVM system provides the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:88
msgid ""
"LLVM contains regression tests in ``llvm/test``.  These tests are run by "
"the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool.  This test procedure uses"
" ``RUN`` lines in the actual test case to determine how to run the test."
"  See the :doc:`TestingGuide` for more details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:93
msgid ""
"LLVM contains an optional package called ``llvm-test``, which provides "
"benchmarks and programs that are known to compile with the Clang front "
"end. You can use these programs to test your code, gather statistical "
"information, and compare it to the current LLVM performance statistics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:98
msgid ""
"Currently, there is no way to hook your tests directly into the "
"``llvm/test`` testing harness. You will simply need to find a way to use "
"the source provided within that directory on your own."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:102
msgid ""
"Typically, you will want to build your **lib** directory first followed "
"by your **tools** directory."

"The LLVM build system provides a convenient way to build libraries and "

"few variables.  Below is a list of the variables one can set and what "

msgid "``LEVEL``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Projects.rst:118
msgid ""
"This variable is the relative path from this ``Makefile`` to the top "
"directory of your project's source code.  For example, if your source "
"code is in ``/tmp/src``, then the ``Makefile`` in ``/tmp/src/jump/high`` "
