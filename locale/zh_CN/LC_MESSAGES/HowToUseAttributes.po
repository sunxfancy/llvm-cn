"Attributes in LLVM have changed in some fundamental ways.  It was "
"necessary to do this to support expanding the attributes to encompass "
"more than a handful of attributes --- e.g. command line options.  The old"
" way of handling attributes consisted of representing them as a bit mask "
"of values.  This bit mask was stored in a \"list\" structure that was "
"reference counted.  The advantage of this was that attributes could be "
"manipulated with 'or's and 'and's.  The disadvantage of this was that "
"there was limited room for expansion, and virtually no support for "
"attribute-value pairs other than alignment."

"In the new scheme, an ``Attribute`` object represents a single attribute "
"that's uniqued.  You use the ``Attribute::get`` methods to create a new "
"``Attribute`` object.  An attribute can be a single \"enum\" value (the "
"enum being the ``Attribute::AttrKind`` enum), a string representing a "
"target-dependent attribute, or an attribute-value pair.  Some examples:"

"Because attributes are no longer represented as a bit mask, you will need"
" to convert any code which does treat them as a bit mask to use the new "
"query methods on the Attribute class."

#: ../../HowToUseAttributes.rst:44
msgid ""
"The ``AttributeSet`` class replaces the old ``AttributeList`` class.  The"
" ``AttributeSet`` stores a collection of Attribute objects for each kind "
"of object that may have an attribute associated with it: the function as "
"a whole, the return type, or the function's parameters.  A function's "
"attributes are at index ``AttributeSet::FunctionIndex``; the return "
"type's attributes are at index ``AttributeSet::ReturnIndex``; and the "
"function's parameters' attributes are at indices 1, ..., n (where 'n' is "
"the number of parameters). Most methods on the ``AttributeSet`` class "
"take an index parameter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToUseAttributes.rst:53
msgid ""
"An ``AttributeSet`` is also a uniqued and immutable object.  You create "
"an ``AttributeSet`` through the ``AttributeSet::get`` methods.  You can "
"add and remove attributes, which result in the creation of a new "
"``AttributeSet``."

"Note: It is advised that you do *not* use the ``AttributeSet`` "
"\"introspection\" methods (e.g. ``Raw``, ``getRawPointer``, etc.).  These"
" methods break encapsulation, and may be removed in a future release "
"(i.e. LLVM 4.0)."

msgid ""
"Lastly, we have a \"builder\" class to help create the ``AttributeSet`` "
"object without having to create several different intermediate uniqued "
"``AttributeSet`` objects.  The ``AttrBuilder`` class allows you to add "
"and remove attributes at will.  The attributes won't be uniqued until you"
" call the appropriate ``AttributeSet::get`` method."

"An ``AttrBuilder`` object is *not* designed to be passed around by value."

"Note: It is advised that you do *not* use the "
"``AttrBuilder::addRawValue()`` method or the ``AttrBuilder(uint64_t "
"Val)`` constructor.  These are for backwards compatibility and may be "
"removed in a future release (i.e. LLVM 4.0)."

"And that's basically it! A lot of functionality is hidden behind these "
