"This document seeks to dispel the mystery and confusion surrounding "
"LLVM's `GetElementPtr <LangRef.html#i_getelementptr>`_ (GEP) instruction."
"  Questions about the wily GEP instruction are probably the most "
"frequently occurring questions once a developer gets down to coding with "
"LLVM. Here we lay out the sources of confusion and show that the GEP "
"instruction is really quite simple."

"When people are first confronted with the GEP instruction, they tend to "
"relate it to known concepts from other programming paradigms, most "
"notably C array indexing and field selection. GEP closely resembles C "
"array indexing and field selection, however it is a little different and "
"this leads to the following questions."

msgid "Quick answer: The index stepping through the first operand."
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:31
msgid ""
"The confusion with the first index usually arises from thinking about the"
" GetElementPtr instruction as if it was a C index operator. They aren't "
"the same. For example, when we write, in \"C\":"
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:41
msgid ""
"it is natural to think that there is only one index, the selection of the"
" field ``F``.  However, in this example, ``Foo`` is a pointer. That "
"pointer must be indexed explicitly in LLVM. C, on the other hand, indices"
" through it transparently.  To arrive at the same address location as the"
" C code, you would provide the GEP instruction with two index operands. "
"The first operand indexes through the pointer; the second operand indexes"
" the field ``F`` of the structure, just as if you wrote:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:53
msgid "Sometimes this question gets rephrased as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:57
msgid ""
"*Why is it okay to index through the first pointer, but subsequent "
"pointers won't be dereferenced?*"
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:60
msgid ""
"The answer is simply because memory does not have to be accessed to "
"perform the computation. The first operand to the GEP instruction must be"
" a value of a pointer type. The value of the pointer is provided directly"
" to the GEP instruction as an operand without any need for accessing "
"memory. It must, therefore be indexed and requires an index operand. "
"Consider this example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:80
msgid ""
"In this \"C\" example, the front end compiler (Clang) will generate three"
" GEP instructions for the three indices through \"P\" in the assignment "
"statement.  The function argument ``P`` will be the first operand of each"
" of these GEP instructions.  The second operand indexes through that "
"pointer.  The third operand will be the field offset into the ``struct "
"munger_struct`` type, for either the ``f1`` or ``f2`` field. So, in LLVM "
"assembly the ``munge`` function looks like:"

"In each case the first operand is the pointer through which the GEP "

msgid "To make this clear, let's consider a more obtuse example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:116
msgid ""
"These GEP instructions are simply making address computations from the "
"base address of ``MyVar``.  They compute, as follows (using C syntax):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:125
msgid ""
"Since the type ``i32`` is known to be four bytes long, the indices 0, 1 "
"and 2 translate into memory offsets of 0, 4, and 8, respectively. No "
"memory is accessed to make these computations because the address of "
"``%MyVar`` is passed directly to the GEP instructions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:130
#, python-format
msgid ""
"The obtuse part of this example is in the cases of ``%idx2`` and "
"``%idx3``. They result in the computation of addresses that point to "
"memory past the end of the ``%MyVar`` global, which is only one ``i32`` "
"long, not three ``i32``\\s long. While this is legal in LLVM, it is "
"inadvisable because any load or store with the pointer that results from "
"these GEP instructions would produce undefined results."

"This question arises most often when the GEP instruction is applied to a "

"The GEP above yields an ``i32*`` by indexing the ``i32`` typed field of "

"globals and GEPs work reveals the need. Becoming aware of the following "
"facts will dispel the confusion:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:157
msgid ""
"The type of ``%MyStruct`` is *not* ``{ float*, i32 }`` but rather ``{ "

"The first index, ``i64 0`` is required to step over the global variable "

"The GetElementPtr instruction dereferences nothing. That is, it doesn't "

"In this example, we have a global variable, ``%MyVar`` that is a pointer "

"array of ints. However, this is actually an illegal GEP instruction. It "
"won't compile. The reason is that the pointer in the structure *must* be "
"dereferenced in order to index into the array of 40 ints. Since the GEP "
"instruction never accesses memory, it is illegal."

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:275
msgid "It's very similar; there are only subtle differences."
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:277
msgid ""
"With ptrtoint, you have to pick an integer type. One approach is to pick "
"i64; this is safe on everything LLVM supports (LLVM internally assumes "

"there are some cases where it doesn't do this. With GEP you can avoid "
"this problem."

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:284
msgid ""
"Also, GEP carries additional pointer aliasing rules. It's invalid to take"
" a GEP from one object, address into a different separately allocated "

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:299
msgid ""
"You don't. The integer computation implied by a GEP is target-"

msgid ""
"If you require support for addressing units which are not 8 bits, you'll "

msgid "How does VLA addressing work with GEPs?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:314
msgid ""
"GEPs don't natively support VLAs. LLVM's type system is entirely static, "
"and GEP address computations are guided by an LLVM type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:317
msgid ""
"VLA indices can be implemented as linearized indices. For example, an "
"expression like ``X[a][b][c]``, must be effectively lowered into a form "
"like ``X[a*m+b*n+c]``, so that it appears to the GEP as a single-"
"dimensional array reference."
msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:322
msgid ""
"This means if you want to write an analysis which understands array "
"indices and you want to support VLAs, your code will have to be prepared "
"to reverse-engineer the linearization. One way to solve this problem is "

msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:343
msgid ""
"A common example of how this is used is arrays where the size is not "

msgstr ""

#: ../../GetElementPtr.rst:350
