"Without special runtime support, debugging dynamically generated code "
"with GDB (as well as most debuggers) can be quite painful.  Debuggers "
"generally read debug information from the object file of the code, but "
"for JITed code, there is no such file to look for."

"In order to communicate the necessary debug info to GDB, an interface for"
" registering JITed code with debuggers has been designed and implemented "
"for GDB and LLVM MCJIT.  At a high level, whenever MCJIT generates new "
"machine code, it does so in an in-memory object file that contains the "
"debug information in DWARF format.  MCJIT then adds this in-memory object"
" file to a global list of dynamically generated object files and calls a "
"special function (``__jit_debug_register_code``) marked noinline that GDB"
" knows about.  When GDB attaches to a process, it puts a breakpoint in "
"this function and loads all of the object files in the global list.  When"
" MCJIT calls the registration function, GDB catches the breakpoint "
"signal, loads the new object file from the inferior's memory, and resumes"
" the execution.  In this way, GDB can get the necessary debug "
"information."

"In order to debug code JIT-ed by LLVM, you need GDB 7.0 or newer, which "
"is available on most modern distributions of Linux.  The version of GDB "
"that Apple ships with Xcode has been frozen at 6.3 for a while.  LLDB may"
" be a better option for debugging JIT-ed code on Mac OS X."

"The emerging MCJIT component of LLVM allows full debugging of JIT-ed code"
