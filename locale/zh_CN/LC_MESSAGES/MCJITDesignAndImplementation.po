"This document describes the internal workings of the MCJIT execution "

"overview of the implementation, showing the flow and interactions of "
"objects throughout the code generation and dynamic loading process."

"In most cases, an EngineBuilder object is used to create an instance of "
"the MCJIT execution engine.  The EngineBuilder takes an llvm::Module "
"object as an argument to its constructor.  The client may then set "
"various options that we control the later be passed along to the MCJIT "
"engine, including the selection of MCJIT as the engine type to be "
"created. Of particular interest is the "
"EngineBuilder::setMCJITMemoryManager function.  If the client does not "
"explicitly create a memory manager at this time, a default memory manager"
" (specifically SectionMemoryManager) will be created when the MCJIT "
"engine is instantiated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:26
msgid ""
"Once the options have been set, a client calls EngineBuilder::create to "
"create an instance of the MCJIT engine.  If the client does not use the "
"form of this function that takes a TargetMachine as a parameter, a new "
"TargetMachine will be created based on the target triple associated with "
"the Module that was used to create the EngineBuilder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:34
msgid ""
"EngineBuilder::create will call the static MCJIT::createJIT function, "

"The MCJIT class has a member variable, Dyld, which contains an instance "
"of the RuntimeDyld wrapper class.  This member will be used for "
"communications between MCJIT and the actual RuntimeDyldImpl object that "
"gets created when an object is loaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:45
msgid ""
"Upon creation, MCJIT holds a pointer to the Module object that it "
"received from EngineBuilder but it does not immediately generate code for"
" this module.  Code generation is deferred until either the "
"MCJIT::finalizeObject method is called explicitly or a function such as "
"MCJIT::getPointerToFunction is called which requires the code to have "
"been generated."

"When code generation is triggered, as described above, MCJIT will first "
"attempt to retrieve an object image from its ObjectCache member, if one "
"has been set.  If a cached object image cannot be retrieved, MCJIT will "
"call its emitObject method.  MCJIT::emitObject uses a local PassManager "
"instance and creates a new ObjectBufferStream instance, both of which it "
"passes to TargetMachine::addPassesToEmitMC before calling "
"PassManager::run on the Module with which it was created."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:65
msgid ""
"The PassManager::run call causes the MC code generation mechanisms to "
"emit a complete relocatable binary object image (either in either ELF or "
"MachO format, depending on the target) into the ObjectBufferStream "
"object, which is flushed to complete the process.  If an ObjectCache is "
"being used, the image will be passed to the ObjectCache here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:71
msgid ""
"At this point, the ObjectBufferStream contains the raw object image. "
"Before the code can be executed, the code and data sections from this "
"image must be loaded into suitable memory, relocations must be applied "
"and memory permission and code cache invalidation (if required) must be "
"completed."

#: ../../MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:79
msgid ""
"Once an object image has been obtained, either through code generation or"
" having been retrieved from an ObjectCache, it is passed to RuntimeDyld "
"to be loaded.  The RuntimeDyld wrapper class examines the object to "
"determine its file format and creates an instance of either "
"RuntimeDyldELF or RuntimeDyldMachO (both of which derive from the "
"RuntimeDyldImpl base class) and calls the RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject "
"method to perform that actual loading."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject begins by creating an ObjectImage instance "
"from the ObjectBuffer it received.  ObjectImage, which wraps the "

"headers, including section, symbol and relocation information."

"RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject then iterates through the symbols in the "
"image.  Information about common symbols is collected for later use.  For"
" each function or data symbol, the associated section is loaded into "
"memory and the symbol is stored in a symbol table map data structure.  "
"When the iteration is complete, a section is emitted for the common "
"symbols."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:101
msgid ""
"Next, RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject iterates through the sections in the "
"object image and for each section iterates through the relocations for "
"that sections.  For each relocation, it calls the format-specific "
"processRelocationRef method, which will examine the relocation and store "
"it in one of two data structures, a section-based relocation list map and"
" an external symbol relocation map."

"When RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject returns, all of the code and data "

"[Currently (as of August 2013) the MCJIT engine will immediately apply "
"relocations when loadObject completes.  However, this shouldn't be "
"happening.  Because the code may have been generated for a remote target,"
" the client should be given a chance to re-map the section addresses "
"before relocations are applied.  It is possible to apply relocations "
"multiple times, but in the case where addresses are to be re-mapped, this"
" first application is wasted effort.]"

#: ../../MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:127
msgid ""
"At any time after initial code has been generated and before "
"finalizeObject is called, the client can remap the address of sections in"
" the object.  Typically this is done because the code was generated for "
"an external process and is being mapped into that process' address space."
" The client remaps the section address by calling "
"MCJIT::mapSectionAddress. This should happen before the section memory is"
" copied to its new location."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When MCJIT::mapSectionAddress is called, MCJIT passes the call on to "
"RuntimeDyldImpl (via its Dyld member).  RuntimeDyldImpl stores the new "

"When MCJIT::finalizeObject is called, MCJIT calls "

"any external symbols and then apply all relocations for the object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:150
msgid ""
"External symbols are resolved by calling the memory manager's "
"getPointerToNamedFunction method.  The memory manager will return the "
"address of the requested symbol in the target address space.  (Note, this"
" may not be a valid pointer in the host process.)  RuntimeDyld will then "
"iterate through the list of relocations it has stored which are "
"associated with this symbol and invoke the resolveRelocation method "
"which, through an format-specific implementation, will apply the "
"relocation to the loaded section memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, RuntimeDyld::resolveRelocations iterates through the list of "
"sections and for each section iterates through a list of relocations that"

"for each entry in this list.  The relocation list here is a list of "
"relocations for which the symbol associated with the relocation is "
"located in the section associated with the list.  Each of these locations"
" will have a target location at which the relocation will be applied that"
" is likely located in a different section."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MCJITDesignAndImplementation.rst:170
msgid ""
"Once relocations have been applied as described above, MCJIT calls "
"RuntimeDyld::getEHFrameSection, and if a non-zero result is returned "
"passes the section data to the memory manager's registerEHFrames method. "
"This allows the memory manager to call any desired target-specific "
"functions, such as registering the EH frame information with a debugger."

"Finally, MCJIT calls the memory manager's finalizeMemory method.  In this"
