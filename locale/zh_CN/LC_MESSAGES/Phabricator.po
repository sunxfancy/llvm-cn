" list with questions until then. We also could use help implementing "
"improvements. This sadly is really painful and hard because the "
"Phabricator codebase is in PHP and not as testable as you might like. "
"However, we've put exactly what we're deploying up on an `llvm-reviews "
"GitHub project`_ where folks can hack on it and post pull requests. We're"
" looking into what the right long-term hosting for this is, but note that"
" it is a derivative of an existing open source project, and so not "
"trivially a good fit for an official LLVM project."
