"**llvm-build** is a tool for working with LLVM projects that use the "
"LLVMBuild system for describing their components."

"At heart, **llvm-build** is responsible for loading, verifying, and "
"manipulating the project's component data. The tool is primarily designed"
" for use in implementing build systems and tools which need access to the"
" project structure information."

"Write out new *LLVMBuild.txt* files based on the loaded components. This "
