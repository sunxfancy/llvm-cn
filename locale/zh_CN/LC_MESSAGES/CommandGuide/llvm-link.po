":program:`llvm-link` takes several LLVM bitcode files and links them "
"together into a single LLVM bitcode file.  It writes the output file to "
"standard output, unless the :option:`-o` option is used to specify a "
"filename."

"Enable binary output on terminals.  Normally, :program:`llvm-link` will "
"refuse to write raw bitcode output if the output stream is a terminal. "
"With this option, :program:`llvm-link` will write raw bitcode regardless "
"of the output device."
