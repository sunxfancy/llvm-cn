"The :program:`llvm-cov` tool shows code coverage information for programs"

"profiling."

"The :program:`llvm-cov gcov` tool reads code coverage data files and "
"displays the coverage information for a specified source file. It is "
"compatible with the ``gcov`` tool from version 4.2 of ``GCC`` and may "
"also be compatible with some later versions of ``gcov``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/llvm-cov.rst:48
msgid ""
"To use :program:`llvm-cov gcov`, you must first build an instrumented "
"version of your application that collects coverage data as it runs. "
"Compile with the ``-fprofile-arcs`` and ``-ftest-coverage`` options to "
"add the instrumentation. (Alternatively, you can use the ``--coverage`` "
"option, which includes both of those other options.) You should compile "
"with debugging information (``-g``) and without optimization (``-O0``); "
"otherwise, the coverage data cannot be accurately mapped back to the "
"source code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/llvm-cov.rst:56
msgid ""
"At the time you compile the instrumented code, a ``.gcno`` data file will"
" be generated for each object file. These ``.gcno`` files contain half of"
" the coverage data. The other half of the data comes from ``.gcda`` files"
" that are generated when you run the instrumented program, with a "
"separate ``.gcda`` file for each object file. Each time you run the "
"program, the execution counts are summed into any existing ``.gcda`` "
"files, so be sure to remove any old files if you do not want their "
"contents to be included."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/llvm-cov.rst:64
msgid ""
"By default, the ``.gcda`` files are written into the same directory as "
"the object files, but you can override that by setting the "
"``GCOV_PREFIX`` and ``GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP`` environment variables. The "
"``GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP`` variable specifies a number of directory components"
" to be removed from the start of the absolute path to the object file "
"directory. After stripping those directories, the prefix from the "
"``GCOV_PREFIX`` variable is added. These environment variables allow you "
"to run the instrumented program on a machine where the original object "
"file directories are not accessible, but you will then need to copy the "
"``.gcda`` files back to the object file directories where :program:`llvm-"
"cov gcov` expects to find them."

msgid ""
"Once you have generated the coverage data files, run :program:`llvm-cov "
"gcov` for each main source file where you want to examine the coverage "
"results. This should be run from the same directory where you previously "
"ran the compiler. The results for the specified source file are written "
"to a file named by appending a ``.gcov`` suffix. A separate output file "
"is also created for each file included by the main source file, also with"
" a ``.gcov`` suffix added."

"The basic content of an ``.gcov`` output file is a copy of the source "

"executable code. If a line contains code but that code was never "
"executed, the count is displayed as ``#####``."
