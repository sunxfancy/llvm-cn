":program:`FileCheck` reads two files (one from standard input, and one "
"specified on the command line) and uses one to verify the other.  This "
"behavior is particularly useful for the testsuite, which wants to verify "
"that the output of some tool (e.g. :program:`llc`) contains the expected "
"information (for example, a movsd from esp or whatever is interesting).  "
"This is similar to using :program:`grep`, but it is optimized for "
"matching multiple different inputs in one file in a specific order."

"The ``match-filename`` file specifies the file that contains the patterns"

"FileCheck searches the contents of ``match-filename`` for patterns to "
"match.  By default, these patterns are prefixed with \"``CHECK:``\". If "
"you'd like to use a different prefix (e.g. because the same input file is"
" checking multiple different tool or options), the :option:`--check-"
"prefix` argument allows you to specify one or more prefixes to match. "
"Multiple prefixes are useful for tests which might change for different "
"run options, but most lines remain the same."

"By default, FileCheck canonicalizes input horizontal whitespace (spaces "
"and tabs) which causes it to ignore these differences (a space will match"

"This syntax says to pipe the current file (\"``%s``\") into ``llvm-as``, "
"pipe that into ``llc``, then pipe the output of ``llc`` into "
"``FileCheck``.  This means that FileCheck will be verifying its standard "
"input (the llc output) against the filename argument specified (the "
"original ``.ll`` file specified by \"``%s``\").  To see how this works, "
"let's look at the rest of the ``.ll`` file (after the RUN line):"

"Here you can see some \"``CHECK:``\" lines specified in comments.  Now "

"The syntax of the \"``CHECK:``\" lines is very simple: they are fixed "
"strings that must occur in order.  FileCheck defaults to ignoring "
"horizontal whitespace differences (e.g. a space is allowed to match a "

"One nice thing about FileCheck (compared to grep) is that it allows "
"merging test cases together into logical groups.  For example, because "
"the test above is checking for the \"``sub1:``\" and \"``inc4:``\" "
"labels, it will not match unless there is a \"``subl``\" in between those"
" labels.  If it existed somewhere else in the file, that would not count:"

msgstr ""

"``CHECK-NOT:`` directives could be mixed with ``CHECK-DAG:`` directives "

"With captured variables, ``CHECK-DAG:`` is able to match valid "

msgid "The \"CHECK-LABEL:\" directive"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:316
msgid ""
"Sometimes in a file containing multiple tests divided into logical "
"blocks, one or more ``CHECK:`` directives may inadvertently succeed by "
"matching lines in a later block. While an error will usually eventually "
"be generated, the check flagged as causing the error may not actually "
"bear any relationship to the actual source of the problem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:322
msgid ""
"In order to produce better error messages in these cases, the \"``CHECK-"
"LABEL:``\" directive can be used. It is treated identically to a normal "
"``CHECK`` directive except that FileCheck makes an additional assumption "
"that a line matched by the directive cannot also be matched by any other "
"check present in ``match-filename``; this is intended to be used for "
"lines containing labels or other unique identifiers. Conceptually, the "
"presence of ``CHECK-LABEL`` divides the input stream into separate "
"blocks, each of which is processed independently, preventing a ``CHECK:``"
" directive in one block matching a line in another block. For example,"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:351
msgid ""
"The use of ``CHECK-LABEL:`` directives in this case ensures that the "
"three ``CHECK:`` directives only accept lines corresponding to the body "
"of the ``@C_ctor_base`` function, even if the patterns match lines found "
"later in the file. Furthermore, if one of these three ``CHECK:`` "
"directives fail, FileCheck will recover by continuing to the next block, "
"allowing multiple test failures to be detected in a single invocation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:358
msgid ""
"There is no requirement that ``CHECK-LABEL:`` directives contain strings "

msgid ""
"All FileCheck directives take a pattern to match. For most uses of "
"FileCheck, fixed string matching is perfectly sufficient.  For some "
"things, a more flexible form of matching is desired.  To support this, "
"FileCheck allows you to specify regular expressions in matching strings, "
"surrounded by double braces: ``{{yourregex}}``.  Because we want to use "
"fixed string matching for a majority of what we do, FileCheck has been "
"designed to support mixing and matching fixed string matching with "
"regular expressions. This allows you to write things like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:380
msgid ""
"In this case, any offset from the ESP register will be allowed, and any "
"xmm register will be allowed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:383
msgid ""
"Because regular expressions are enclosed with double braces, they are "
"visually distinct, and you don't need to use escape characters within the"
" double braces like you would in C.  In the rare case that you want to "
"match double braces explicitly from the input, you can use something ugly"
" like ``{{[{][{]}}`` as your pattern."

msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:392
msgid ""
"It is often useful to match a pattern and then verify that it occurs "
"again later in the file.  For codegen tests, this can be useful to allow "
"any register, but verify that that register is used consistently later.  "
"To do this, :program:`FileCheck` allows named variables to be defined and"
" substituted into patterns.  Here is a simple example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:404
msgid ""
"The first check line matches a regex ``%[a-z]+`` and captures it into the"
" variable ``REGISTER``.  The second line verifies that whatever is in "
"``REGISTER`` occurs later in the file after an \"``andw``\".  "
":program:`FileCheck` variable references are always contained in ``[[ "
"]]`` pairs, and their names can be formed with the regex "
"``[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*``.  If a colon follows the name, then it is a "
"definition of the variable; otherwise, it is a use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:411
msgid ""
":program:`FileCheck` variables can be defined multiple times, and uses "
"always get the latest value.  Variables can also be used later on the "
"same line they were defined on. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:419
msgid ""
"Can be useful if you want the operands of ``op`` to be the same register,"
" and don't care exactly which register it is."
msgstr ""

msgid "FileCheck Expressions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:425
msgid ""
"Sometimes there's a need to verify output which refers line numbers of "
"the match file, e.g. when testing compiler diagnostics.  This introduces "
"a certain fragility of the match file structure, as \"``CHECK:``\" lines "
"contain absolute line numbers in the same file, which have to be updated "
"whenever line numbers change due to text addition or deletion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:431
msgid ""
"To support this case, FileCheck allows using ``[[@LINE]]``, "
"``[[@LINE+<offset>]]``, ``[[@LINE-<offset>]]`` expressions in patterns. "
"These expressions expand to a number of the line where a pattern is "
"located (with an optional integer offset)."
