":program:`lli` directly executes programs in LLVM bitcode format.  It "
"takes a program in LLVM bitcode format and executes it using a just-in-"
"time compiler or an interpreter."

":program:`lli` is *not* an emulator. It will not execute IR of different "
"architectures and it can only interpret (or JIT-compile) for the host "
"architecture."

":program:`llc`, but they don't necessarily work for the interpreter."
