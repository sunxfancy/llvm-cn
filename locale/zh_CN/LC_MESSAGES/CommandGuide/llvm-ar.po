msgid ""
"The **llvm-ar** command is similar to the common Unix utility, ``ar``. It"
" archives several files together into a single file. The intent for this "
"is to produce archive libraries by LLVM bitcode that can be linked into "
"an LLVM program. However, the archive can contain any kind of file. By "
"default, **llvm-ar** generates a symbol table that makes linking faster "
"because only the symbol table needs to be consulted, not each individual "
"file member of the archive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/llvm-ar.rst:24
msgid ""
"The **llvm-ar** command can be used to *read* SVR4, GNU and BSD style "
"archive files. However, right now it can only write in the GNU format. If"
" an SVR4 or BSD style archive is used with the ``r`` (replace) or ``q`` "
"(quick update) operations, the archive will be reconstructed in GNU "
"format."

msgid ""
"The options to **llvm-ar** are compatible with other ``ar`` "
"implementations. However, there are a few modifiers (*R*) that are not "
"found in other ``ar`` implementations. The options to **llvm-ar** specify"
" a single basic operation to perform on the archive, a variety of "
"modifiers for that operation, the name of the archive file, and an "
"optional list of file names. These options are used to determine how "
"**llvm-ar** should process the archive file."

msgid ""
"The Operations and Modifiers are explained in the sections below. The "
"minimal set of options is at least one operator and the name of the "
"archive. Typically archive files end with a ``.a`` suffix, but this is "
"not required. Following the *archive-name* comes a list of *files* that "
"indicate the specific members of the archive to operate on. If the "
"*files* option is not specified, it generally means either \"none\" or "
"\"all\" members, depending on the operation."
