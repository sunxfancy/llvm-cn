msgid ""
"The :program:`opt` command is the modular LLVM optimizer and analyzer.  "
"It takes LLVM source files as input, runs the specified optimizations or "
"analyses on it, and then outputs the optimized file or the analysis "
"results.  The function of :program:`opt` depends on whether the "
":option:`-analyze` option is given."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/opt.rst:18
msgid ""
"When :option:`-analyze` is specified, :program:`opt` performs various "
"analyses of the input source.  It will usually print the results on "
"standard output, but in a few cases, it will print output to standard "
"error or generate a file with the analysis output, which is usually done "
"when the output is meant for another program."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/opt.rst:24
msgid ""
"While :option:`-analyze` is *not* given, :program:`opt` attempts to "
"produce an optimized output file.  The optimizations available via "
":program:`opt` depend upon what libraries were linked into it as well as "
"any additional libraries that have been loaded with the :option:`-load` "
"option.  Use the :option:`-help` option to determine what optimizations "
"you can use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/opt.rst:30
msgid ""
"If ``filename`` is omitted from the command line or is \"``-``\", "
":program:`opt` reads its input from standard input.  Inputs can be in "
"either the LLVM assembly language format (``.ll``) or the LLVM bitcode "
"format (``.bc``)."

"Enable binary output on terminals.  Normally, :program:`opt` will refuse "
"to write raw bitcode output if the output stream is a terminal.  With "
"this option, :program:`opt` will write raw bitcode regardless of the "
"output device."

":program:`opt` provides the ability to run any of LLVM's optimization or "
"analysis passes in any order.  The :option:`-help` option lists all the "
"passes available.  The order in which the options occur on the command "
"line are the order in which they are executed (within pass constraints)."

"This option is only meaningful when :option:`-std-link-opts` is given.  "
"It disables most passes."

msgid ""
"This option causes opt to strip debug information from the module before "
"applying other optimizations.  It is essentially the same as "
":option:`-strip` but it ensures that stripping of debug information is "
"done first."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/opt.rst:82
msgid ""
"This option causes opt to add a verify pass after every pass otherwise "
"specified on the command line (including :option:`-verify`).  This is "
"useful for cases where it is suspected that a pass is creating an invalid"
" module but it is not clear which pass is doing it."
