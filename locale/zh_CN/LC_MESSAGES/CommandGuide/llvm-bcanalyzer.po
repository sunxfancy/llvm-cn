msgid ""
"The :program:`llvm-bcanalyzer` command is a small utility for analyzing "
"bitcode files.  The tool reads a bitcode file (such as generated with the"
" :program:`llvm-as` tool) and produces a statistical report on the "
"contents of the bitcode file.  The tool can also dump a low level but "
"human readable version of the bitcode file.  This tool is probably not of"
" much interest or utility except for those working directly with the "
"bitcode file format.  Most LLVM users can just ignore this tool."
