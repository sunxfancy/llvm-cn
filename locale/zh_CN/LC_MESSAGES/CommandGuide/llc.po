msgid ""
"The :program:`llc` command compiles LLVM source inputs into assembly "
"language for a specified architecture.  The assembly language output can "
"then be passed through a native assembler and linker to generate a native"
" executable."

"The choice of architecture for the output assembly code is automatically "
"determined from the input file, unless the :option:`-march` option is "

"If ``filename`` is \"``-``\" or omitted, :program:`llc` reads from "
"standard input. Otherwise, it will from ``filename``.  Inputs can be in "
"either the LLVM assembly language format (``.ll``) or the LLVM bitcode "
"format (``.bc``)."

"If the :option:`-o` option is omitted, then :program:`llc` will send its "

":option:`-o` option specifies \"``-``\", then the output will also be "
"sent to standard output."

#: ../../CommandGuide/llc.rst:31
msgid ""
"If no :option:`-o` option is specified and an input file other than "
"\"``-``\" is specified, then :program:`llc` creates the output filename "
