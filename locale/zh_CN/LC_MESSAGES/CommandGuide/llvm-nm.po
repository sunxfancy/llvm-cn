"The :program:`llvm-nm` utility lists the names of symbols from the LLVM "
"bitcode files, object files, or :program:`ar` archives containing them, "
"named on the command line.  Each symbol is listed along with some simple "
"information about its provenance.  If no file name is specified, or *-* "
"is used as a file name, :program:`llvm-nm` will process a file on its "
"standard input stream."

":program:`llvm-nm`'s default output format is the traditional BSD "
":program:`nm` output format.  Each such output record consists of an "
"(optional) 8-digit hexadecimal address, followed by a type code "
"character, followed by a name, for each symbol.  One record is printed "
"per line; fields are separated by spaces. When the address is omitted, it"
" is replaced by 8 spaces."
