msgid ""
"**llvm-diff** compares the structure of two LLVM modules, primarily "
"focusing on differences in function definitions.  Insignificant "
"differences, such as changes in the ordering of globals or in the names "
"of local values, are ignored."

"An input module will be interpreted as an assembly file if its name ends "
"in '.ll';  otherwise it will be read in as a bitcode file."

msgid ""
"If a list of global names is given, just the values with those names are "
"compared; otherwise, all global values are compared, and diagnostics are "
"produced for globals which only appear in one module or the other."

#: ../../CommandGuide/llvm-diff.rst:29
msgid ""
"**llvm-diff** compares two functions by comparing their basic blocks, "
"beginning with the entry blocks.  If the terminators seem to match, then "
"the corresponding successors are compared; otherwise they are ignored.  "
"This algorithm is very sensitive to changes in control flow, which tend "
"to stop any downstream changes from being detected."

"**llvm-diff** is intended as a debugging tool for writers of LLVM passes "
"and frontends.  It does not have a stable output format."

msgid "EXIT STATUS"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/llvm-diff.rst:43
msgid ""
"If **llvm-diff** finds no differences between the modules, it will exit "
"with 0 and produce no output.  Otherwise it will exit with a non-zero "
"value."

"Many important differences, like changes in linkage or function "

"Changes in memory behavior (for example, coalescing loads) can cause "
"massive detected differences in blocks."
