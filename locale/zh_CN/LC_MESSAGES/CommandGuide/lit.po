":program:`lit` is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test"
" suites, summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures."
" :program:`lit` is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as "
"simple a user interface as possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandGuide/lit.rst:17
msgid ""
":program:`lit` should be run with one or more *tests* to run specified on"

"Each specified test will be executed (potentially in parallel) and once "
"all tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on "
"the number of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-"

"code if any tests fail."

"In the :program:`lit` model, every test must exist inside some *test "
