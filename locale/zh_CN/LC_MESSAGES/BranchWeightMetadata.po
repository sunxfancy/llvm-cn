"Branch Weight Metadata represents branch weights as its likeliness to be "
"taken (see :doc:`BlockFrequencyTerminology`). Metadata is assigned to the"
" ``TerminatorInst`` as a ``MDNode`` of the ``MD_prof`` kind. The first "
"operator is always a ``MDString`` node with the string "
"\"branch_weights\".  Number of operators depends on the terminator type."
