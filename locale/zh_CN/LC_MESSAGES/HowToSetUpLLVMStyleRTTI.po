"This section describes how to set up the most basic form of LLVM-style "

"The most basic working setup for LLVM-style RTTI requires the following "
"steps:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:56
msgid ""
"In the header where you declare ``Shape``, you will want to ``#include "
"\"llvm/Support/Casting.h\"``, which declares LLVM's RTTI templates. That "
"way your clients don't even have to think about it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:64
msgid ""
"In the base class, introduce an enum which discriminates all of the "
"different concrete classes in the hierarchy, and stash the enum value "
"somewhere in the base class."
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:68
msgid "Here is the code after introducing this change:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:88
msgid ""
"You will usually want to keep the ``Kind`` member encapsulated and "
"private, but let the enum ``ShapeKind`` be public along with providing a "
"``getKind()`` method. This is convenient for clients so that they can do "
"a ``switch`` over the enum."
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:93
msgid ""
"A common naming convention is that these enums are \"kind\"s, to avoid "
"ambiguity with the words \"type\" or \"class\" which have overloaded "
"meanings in many contexts within LLVM. Sometimes there will be a natural "
"name for it, like \"opcode\". Don't bikeshed over this; when in doubt use"
" ``Kind``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:98
msgid ""
"You might wonder why the ``Kind`` enum doesn't have an entry for "
"``Shape``. The reason for this is that since ``Shape`` is abstract "
"(``computeArea() = 0;``), you will never actually have non-derived "
"instances of exactly that class (only subclasses). See `Concrete Bases "
"and Deeper Hierarchies`_ for information on how to deal with non-abstract"
" bases. It's worth mentioning here that unlike ``dynamic_cast<>``, LLVM-"
"style RTTI can be used (and is often used) for classes that don't have "
"v-tables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:107
msgid ""
"Next, you need to make sure that the ``Kind`` gets initialized to the "
"value corresponding to the dynamic type of the class. Typically, you will"
" want to have it be an argument to the constructor of the base class, and"
" then pass in the respective ``XXXKind`` from subclass constructors."

"Finally, you need to inform LLVM's RTTI templates how to dynamically "
"determine the type of a class (i.e. whether the ``isa<>``/``dyn_cast<>`` "
"should succeed). The default \"99.9% of use cases\" way to accomplish "
"this is through a small static member function ``classof``. In order to "
"have proper context for an explanation, we will display this code first, "
"and then below describe each part:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:196
msgid ""
"The job of ``classof`` is to dynamically determine whether an object of a"
" base class is in fact of a particular derived class.  In order to "
"downcast a type ``Base`` to a type ``Derived``, there needs to be a "
"``classof`` in ``Derived`` which will accept an object of type ``Base``."
msgstr ""

msgid "To be concrete, consider the following code:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:210
msgid ""
"The code of the ``isa<>`` test in this code will eventually boil down---"
"after template instantiation and some other machinery---to a check "
"roughly like ``Circle::classof(S)``. For more information, see :ref"
":`classof-contract`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:215
msgid ""
"The argument to ``classof`` should always be an *ancestor* class because "
"the implementation has logic to allow and optimize away "
"upcasts/up-``isa<>``'s automatically. It is as though every class ``Foo``"
" automatically has a ``classof`` like:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:232
msgid ""
"Note that this is the reason that we did not need to introduce a "
"``classof`` into ``Shape``: all relevant classes derive from ``Shape``, "
"and ``Shape`` itself is abstract (has no entry in the ``Kind`` enum), so "
"this notional inferred ``classof`` is all we need. See `Concrete Bases "
"and Deeper Hierarchies`_ for more information about how to extend this "
"example to more general hierarchies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:239
msgid ""
"Although for this small example setting up LLVM-style RTTI seems like a "
"lot of \"boilerplate\", if your classes are doing anything interesting "
"then this will end up being a tiny fraction of the code."

"For concrete bases (i.e. non-abstract interior nodes of the inheritance "

"complicated. The situation differs from the example above in that"
msgstr ""

"Since the class is concrete, it must itself have an entry in the ``Kind``"

"Say that ``SpecialSquare`` and ``OtherSpecialSquare`` derive from "

msgid "Then in ``Square``, we would need to modify the ``classof`` like so:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:281
msgid ""
"The reason that we need to test a range like this instead of just "
"equality is that both ``SpecialSquare`` and ``OtherSpecialSquare`` "
"\"is-a\" ``Square``, and so ``classof`` needs to return ``true`` for "
"them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.rst:285
msgid ""
"This approach can be made to scale to arbitrarily deep hierarchies. The "
"trick is that you arrange the enum values so that they correspond to a "
"preorder traversal of the class hierarchy tree. With that arrangement, "
"all subclass tests can be done with two comparisons as shown above. If "
"you just list the class hierarchy like a list of bullet points, you'll "
"get the ordering right::"

msgid ""
"As the comment indicates, this code contains a bug. A straightforward and"
" non-clever way to avoid this is to introduce an explicit "

"To be more precise, let ``classof`` be inside a class ``C``.  Then the "

"For example, LLVM-style RTTI can work fine in the presence of multiple-"

"`DeclContext "
"<http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1DeclContext.html>`_ inside "
"Clang. The ``Decl`` hierarchy is done very similarly to the example setup"
" demonstrated in this tutorial. The key part is how to then incorporate "
"``DeclContext``: all that is needed is in ``bool "
"DeclContext::classof(const Decl *)``, which asks the question \"Given a "
"``Decl``, how can I determine if it is-a ``DeclContext``?\". It answers "
"this with a simple switch over the set of ``Decl`` \"kinds\", and "
"returning true for ones that are known to be ``DeclContext``'s."
