"This document contains information about adding instruction mapping "
"support for a target. The motivation behind this feature comes from the "
"need to switch between different instruction formats during various "
"optimizations. One approach could be to use switch cases which list all "
"the instructions along with formats they can transition to. However, it "
"has large maintenance overhead because of the hardcoded instruction "
"names. Also, whenever a new instruction is added in the .td files, all "
"the relevant switch cases should be modified accordingly. Instead, the "
"same functionality could be achieved with TableGen and some support from "
"the .td files for a fraction of maintenance cost."

"TableGen uses relationship models to map instructions with each other. "
"These models are described using ``InstrMapping`` class as a base. Each "
"model sets various fields of the ``InstrMapping`` class such that they "
"can uniquely describe all the instructions using that model. TableGen "
"parses all the relation models and uses the information to construct "
"relation tables which relate instructions with each other. These tables "
"are emitted in the ``XXXInstrInfo.inc`` file along with the functions to "
"query them. Following is the definition of ``InstrMapping`` class "
"definied in Target.td file:"

"Let's say that we want to have a function ``int getPredOpcode(uint16_t "
"Opcode, enum PredSense inPredSense)`` which takes a non-predicated "
"instruction and returns its predicated true or false form depending on "
"some input flag, ``inPredSense``. The first step in the process is to "
"define a relationship model that relates predicated instructions to their"
" non-predicated form by assigning appropriate values to the "
"``InstrMapping`` fields. For this relationship, non-predicated "
"instructions are treated as key instruction since they are the one used "
"to query the interface function."

"TableGen uses the above relationship model to emit relation table that "
"maps non-predicated instructions with their predicated forms. It also "
"outputs the interface function ``int getPredOpcode(uint16_t Opcode, enum "
"PredSense inPredSense)`` to query the table. Here, Function "
"``getPredOpcode`` takes two arguments, opcode of the current instruction "
"and PredSense of the desired instruction, and returns predicated form of "
"the instruction, if found in the relation table. In order for an "
"instruction to be added into the relation table, it needs to include "
"relevant information in its definition. For example, consider following "
"to be the current definitions of ADD, ADD_pt (true) and ADD_pf (false) "
"instructions:"

"In this step, we modify these instructions to include the information "
"required by the relationship model, <tt>getPredOpcode</tt>, so that they "
"can be related."

#: ../../HowToUseInstrMappings.rst:166
msgid ""
"Please note that all the above instructions use ``PredRel`` as a base "
"class. This is extremely important since TableGen uses it as a filter for"
" selecting instructions for ``getPredOpcode`` model. Any instruction not "
"derived from ``PredRel`` is excluded from the analysis. ``BaseOpcode`` is"
" another important field. Since it's selected as a ``RowFields`` of the "
"model, it is required to have the same value for all 3 instructions in "
"order to be related. Next, ``PredSense`` is used to determine their "
"column positions by comparing its value with ``KeyCol`` and "
"``ValueCols``. If an instruction sets its ``PredSense`` value to "
"something not used in the relation model, it will not be assigned a "
"column in the relation table."
