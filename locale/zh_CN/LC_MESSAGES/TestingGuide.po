"Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless "

"ending in ``\\`` are concatenated until a RUN line that doesn't end in "
"``\\`` is found. This concatenated set of RUN lines then constitutes one "
"execution. :program:`lit` will substitute variables and arrange for the "
