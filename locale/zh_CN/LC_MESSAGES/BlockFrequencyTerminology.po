"Block Frequency is a metric for estimating the relative frequency of "
"different basic blocks.  This document describes the terminology that the"
" ``BlockFrequencyInfo`` and ``MachineBlockFrequencyInfo`` analysis passes"
" use."

msgid "Branch Probability"
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:18
msgid ""
"Blocks with multiple successors have probabilities associated with each "
"outgoing edge.  These are called branch probabilities.  For a given "
"block, the sum of its outgoing branch probabilities should be 1.0."

msgid "Branch Weight"
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:25
msgid ""
"Rather than storing fractions on each edge, we store an integer weight. "
"Weights are relative to the other edges of a given predecessor block.  "
"The branch probability associated with a given edge is its own weight "
"divided by the sum of the weights on the predecessor's outgoing edges."

"The probability of branching from block A to block B is 7/15, and the "

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:56
msgid ""
"Block frequency is a relative metric that represents the number of times "
"a block executes.  The ratio of a block frequency to the entry block "
"frequency is the expected number of times the block will execute per "
"entry to the function."

"Block frequency is the main output of the ``BlockFrequencyInfo`` and "
"``MachineBlockFrequencyInfo`` analysis passes."

msgid "Implementation: a series of DAGs"
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:66
msgid ""
"The implementation of the block frequency calculation analyses each loop,"
" bottom-up, ignoring backedges; i.e., as a DAG.  After each loop is "
"processed, it's packaged up to act as a pseudo-node in its parent loop's "
"(or the function's) DAG analysis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:72
msgid "Block Mass"
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:74
msgid ""
"For each DAG, the entry node is assigned a mass of ``UINT64_MAX`` and "
"mass is distributed to successors according to branch weights.  Block "
"Mass uses a fixed-point representation where ``UINT64_MAX`` represents "
"``1.0`` and ``0`` represents a number just above ``0.0``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:79
msgid ""
"After mass is fully distributed, in any cut of the DAG that separates the"
" exit nodes from the entry node, the sum of the block masses of the nodes"
" succeeded by a cut edge should equal ``UINT64_MAX``.  In other words, "
"mass is conserved as it \"falls\" through the DAG."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:84
msgid ""
"If a function's basic block graph is a DAG, then block masses are valid "
"block frequencies.  This works poorly in practise though, since "
"downstream users rely on adding block frequencies together without "
"hitting the maximum."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:89
msgid "Loop Scale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:91
msgid ""
"Loop scale is a metric that indicates how many times a loop iterates per "
"entry. As mass is distributed through the loop's DAG, the (otherwise "
"ignored) backedge mass is collected.  This backedge mass is used to "
"compute the exit frequency, and thus the loop scale."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:97
msgid "Implementation: Getting from mass and scale to frequency"
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:99
msgid ""
"After analysing the complete series of DAGs, each block has a mass (local"
" to its containing loop, if any), and each loop pseudo-node has a loop "
"scale and its own mass (from its parent's DAG)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:103
msgid ""
"We can get an initial frequency assignment (with entry frequency of 1.0) "
"by multiplying these masses and loop scales together.  A given block's "
"frequency is the product of its mass, the mass of containing loops' "
"pseudo nodes, and the containing loops' loop scales."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:108
msgid ""
"Since downstream users need integers (not floating point), this initial "
"frequency assignment is shifted as necessary into the range of "
"``uint64_t``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Block Bias"
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:114
msgid ""
"Block bias is a proposed *absolute* metric to indicate a bias toward or "
"away from a given block during a function's execution.  The idea is that "
"bias can be used in isolation to indicate whether a block is relatively "
"hot or cold, or to compare two blocks to indicate whether one is hotter "
"or colder than the other."
msgstr ""

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:119
msgid ""
"The proposed calculation involves calculating a *reference* block "
"frequency, where:"

#: ../../BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:122
msgid ""
"every branch weight is assumed to be 1 (i.e., every branch probability "
"distribution is even) and"
