"This document is meant to get you writing documentation as fast as "
"possible even if you have no previous experience with Sphinx. The goal is"
" to take someone in the state of \"I want to write documentation and get "
"it added to LLVM's docs\" and turn that into useful documentation mailed "
"to llvm-commits with as little nonsense as possible."

"You can find this document in ``docs/SphinxQuickstartTemplate.rst``. You "

"Focus on *content*. It is easy to fix the Sphinx (reStructuredText) "
"syntax later if necessary, although reStructuredText tries to imitate "
"common plain-text conventions so it should be quite natural. A basic "
"knowledge of reStructuredText syntax is useful when writing the document,"
" so the last ~half of this document (starting with `Example Section`_) "
"gives examples which should cover 99% of use cases."

"You generally should not be writing documentation other than a \"how to\""
