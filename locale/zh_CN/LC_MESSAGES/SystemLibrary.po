"This document provides some details on LLVM's System Library, located in "
"the source at ``lib/System`` and ``include/llvm/System``. The library's "
"purpose is to shield LLVM from the differences between operating systems "
"for the few services LLVM needs from the operating system. Much of LLVM "
"is written using portability features of standard C++. However, in a few "
"areas, system dependent facilities are needed and the System Library is "
"the wrapper around those system calls."

"By centralizing LLVM's use of operating system interfaces, we make it "
"possible for the LLVM tool chain and runtime libraries to be more easily "
"ported to new platforms since (theoretically) only ``lib/System`` needs "
"to be ported.  This library also unclutters the rest of LLVM from #ifdef "
"use and special cases for specific operating systems. Such uses are "
"replaced with simple calls to the interfaces provided in "
"``include/llvm/System``."

"Note that the System Library is not intended to be a complete operating "

"necessary to support LLVM."

"The System Library was written by Reid Spencer who formulated the design "

msgid ""
"In order to keep LLVM portable, LLVM developers should adhere to a set of"
" portability rules associated with the System Library. Adherence to these"
" rules should help the System Library achieve its goal of shielding LLVM "
"from the variations in operating system interfaces and doing so "
"efficiently.  The following sections define the rules needed to fulfill "
"this objective."

"Except in ``lib/System``, no LLVM source code should directly "
"``#include`` a system header. Care has been taken to remove all such "
"``#includes`` from LLVM while ``lib/System`` was being developed.  "
"Specifically this means that header files like \"``unistd.h``\", "
"\"``windows.h``\", \"``stdio.h``\", and \"``string.h``\" are forbidden to"
" be included by LLVM source code outside the implementation of "
"``lib/System``."

"To obtain system-dependent functionality, existing interfaces to the "

"The entry points specified in the interface of ``lib/System`` must be "

" conjunction with one another by LLVM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SystemLibrary.rst:92
msgid ""
"For example, consider what is needed to execute a program, wait for it to"
" complete, and return its result code. On Unix, this involves the "
"following operating system calls: ``getenv``, ``fork``, ``execve``, and "
"``wait``. The correct thing for ``lib/System`` to provide is a function, "

"The implementation of a function for a given platform must be written "

"For example, the ``stat`` system call is notorious for having variations "

"discovering information about files and directories. Those interfaces may"
" be implemented in terms of ``stat`` but that is strictly an "
"implementation detail. The interface provided by the System Library must "

msgid "Minimize Soft Errors"
msgstr ""

#: ../../SystemLibrary.rst:156
msgid ""
"Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for "
"every little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can "
"divide these error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and "
"abnormal/bad/hard. That is, some of the errors are simply information "
"like \"file not found\", \"insufficient privileges\", etc. while other "
"errors are much harder like \"out of space\", \"bad disk sector\", or "
"\"system call interrupted\". We'll call the first group \"*soft*\" errors"
" and the second group \"*hard*\" errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SystemLibrary.rst:164
msgid ""
"``lib/System`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors.  This is a "
"design requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the"
" granularity and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find "
"that you're wanting to throw soft errors, you must review the granularity"
" of the interface because it is likely you're trying to implement "
"something that is too low level. The rule of thumb is to provide "
"interface functions that **can't** fail, except when faced with hard "
"errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SystemLibrary.rst:172
msgid ""
"For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an "
"\"``OpenFileForWriting``\" function. For many operating systems, if the "
"file doesn't exist, attempting to open the file will produce an error.  "
"However, ``lib/System`` should not simply throw that error if it occurs "
"because its a soft error. The problem is that the interface function, "
"``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be "
"``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft \"doesn't exist\""
" error, this function would just create it and then open it for writing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SystemLibrary.rst:180
msgid ""
"This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/System`` because it"
" avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of "
"LLVM. Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM "
"tool so don't be bashful about throwing them."

msgid "No throw Specifications"
msgstr ""

#: ../../SystemLibrary.rst:197
msgid ""
"None of the ``lib/System`` interface functions may be declared with C++ "
"``throw()`` specifications on them. This requirement makes sure that the "
"compiler does not insert additional exception handling code into the "
"interface functions. This is a performance consideration: ``lib/System`` "
"functions are at the bottom of many call chains and as such can be "
"frequently called. We need them to be as efficient as possible.  However,"
" no routines in the system library should actually throw exceptions."

"Implementations of the System Library interface are separated by their "
"general class of operating system. Currently only Unix and Win32 classes "
"are defined but more could be added for other operating system "
"classifications.  To distinguish which implementation to compile, the "
"code in ``lib/System`` uses the ``LLVM_ON_UNIX`` and ``LLVM_ON_WIN32`` "
"``#defines`` provided via configure through the ``llvm/Config/config.h`` "
"file. Each source file in ``lib/System``, after implementing the generic "
"(operating system independent) functionality needs to include the correct"
" implementation using a set of ``#if defined(LLVM_ON_XYZ)`` directives. "

"The implementation in ``lib/System/Unix/File.cpp`` should handle all Unix"

"The implementation of a ``lib/System`` interface can vary drastically "

" function is the same. For example, a function to create a directory is "
"pretty straight forward on all operating system. System V IPC on the "
"other hand isn't even supported on all platforms. Instead of "
"\"supporting\" System V IPC, ``lib/System`` should provide an interface "
"to the basic concept of inter-process communications. The implementations"
" might use System V IPC if that was available or named pipes, or whatever"
" gets the job done effectively for a given operating system.  In all "
"cases, the interface and the implementation must be semantically "
"consistent."
