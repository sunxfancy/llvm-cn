"The LLVM source-base makes extensive use of a custom form of RTTI.  These"

"Because they are used so often, you must know what they do and how they "

"The ``dyn_cast<>`` operator is a \"checking cast\" operation.  It checks "

"pointer to it (this operator does not work with references).  If the "
"operand is not of the correct type, a null pointer is returned.  Thus, "
"this works very much like the ``dynamic_cast<>`` operator in C++, and "

"operator is used in an ``if`` statement or some other flow control "
"statement like this:"

"There are two different design patterns that tend to result in the use of"
" virtual dispatch for methods in a type hierarchy in C++ programs. The "
"first is a genuine type hierarchy where different types in the hierarchy "
"model a specific subset of the functionality and semantics, and these "
"types nest strictly within each other. Good examples of this can be seen "
"in the ``Value`` or ``Type`` type hierarchies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ProgrammersManual.rst:2510

"A second is the desire to dispatch dynamically across a collection of "
"polymorphic interface implementations. This latter use case can be "
"modeled with virtual dispatch and inheritance by defining an abstract "
"interface base class which all implementations derive from and override. "
"However, this implementation strategy forces an **\"is-a\"** relationship"
" to exist that is not actually meaningful. There is often not some nested"
" hierarchy of useful generalizations which code might interact with and "
"move up and down. Instead, there is a singular interface which is "
"dispatched across a range of implementations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ProgrammersManual.rst:2520
msgid ""
"The preferred implementation strategy for the second use case is that of "
"generic programming (sometimes called \"compile-time duck typing\" or "
"\"static polymorphism\"). For example, a template over some type "
"parameter ``T`` can be instantiated across any particular implementation "
"that conforms to the interface or *concept*. A good example here is the "
"highly generic properties of any type which models a node in a directed "
"graph. LLVM models these primarily through templates and generic "
"programming. Such templates include the ``LoopInfoBase`` and "
"``DominatorTreeBase``. When this type of polymorphism truly needs "
"**dynamic** dispatch you can generalize it using a technique called "
"*concept-based polymorphism*. This pattern emulates the interfaces and "
"behaviors of templates using a very limited form of virtual dispatch for "
"type erasure inside its implementation. You can find examples of this "
"technique in the ``PassManager.h`` system, and there is a more detailed "
"introduction to it by Sean Parent in several of his talks and papers:"
