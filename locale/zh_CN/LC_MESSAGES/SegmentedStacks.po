"Segmented stack allows stack space to be allocated incrementally than as "
"a monolithic chunk (of some worst case size) at thread initialization. "
"This is done by allocating stack blocks (henceforth called *stacklets*) "
"and linking them into a doubly linked list. The function prologue is "
"responsible for checking if the current stacklet has enough space for the"
" function to execute; and if not, call into the libgcc runtime to "
"allocate more stack space. Segmented stacks are enabled with the "
"``\"split-stack\"`` attribute on LLVM functions."

"As mentioned above, the function prologue checks if the current stacklet "
"has enough space. The current approach is to use a slot in the TCB to "
"store the current stack limit (minus the amount of space needed to "
"allocate a new block) - this slot's offset is again dictated by "
"``libgcc``. The generated assembly looks like this on x86-64:"

#: ../../SegmentedStacks.rst:50

"The size of function arguments on the stack needs to be passed to "
"``__morestack`` (this function is implemented in ``libgcc``) since that "
"number of bytes has to be copied from the previous stacklet to the "
"current one. This is so that SP (and FP) relative addressing of function "
"arguments work as expected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SegmentedStacks.rst:55
msgid ""
"The unusual ``ret`` is needed to have the function which made a call to "
"``__morestack`` return correctly. ``__morestack``, instead of returning, "
"calls into ``.LBB0_2``. This is possible since both, the size of the "
"``ret`` instruction and the PC of call to ``__morestack`` are known. When"
" the function body returns, control is transferred back to "
"``__morestack``. ``__morestack`` then de-allocates the new stacklet, "
"restores the correct SP value, and does a second return, which returns "
"control to the correct caller."

"The section on `allocating stacklets`_ automatically assumes that every "
"stack frame will be of fixed size. However, LLVM allows the use of the "
"``llvm.alloca`` intrinsic to allocate dynamically sized blocks of memory "
"on the stack. When faced with such a variable-sized alloca, code is "
"generated to:"
