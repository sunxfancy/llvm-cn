"This document describes the CommandLine argument processing library.  It "
"will show you how to use it, and what it can do.  The CommandLine library"
" uses a declarative approach to specifying the command line options that "
"your program takes.  By default, these options declarations implicitly "
"hold the value parsed for the option declared (of course this `can be "
"changed`_)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:17
msgid ""
"Although there are a **lot** of command line argument parsing libraries "
"out there in many different languages, none of them fit well with what I "
"needed.  By looking at the features and problems of other libraries, I "
"designed the CommandLine library to have the following features:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:22
msgid ""
"Speed: The CommandLine library is very quick and uses little resources.  "
"The parsing time of the library is directly proportional to the number of"
" arguments parsed, not the number of options recognized.  Additionally, "
"command line argument values are captured transparently into user defined"
" global variables, which can be accessed like any other variable (and "
"with the same performance)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:29
msgid ""
"Type Safe: As a user of CommandLine, you don't have to worry about "
"remembering the type of arguments that you want (is it an int?  a string?"
" a bool? an enum?) and keep casting it around.  Not only does this help "
"prevent error prone constructs, it also leads to dramatically cleaner "
"source code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:34
msgid ""
"No subclasses required: To use CommandLine, you instantiate variables "
"that correspond to the arguments that you would like to capture, you "
"don't subclass a parser.  This means that you don't have to write **any**"
" boilerplate code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:39
msgid ""
"Globally accessible: Libraries can specify command line arguments that "
"are automatically enabled in any tool that links to the library.  This is"
" possible because the application doesn't have to keep a list of "
"arguments to pass to the parser.  This also makes supporting `dynamically"
" loaded options`_ trivial."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:45
msgid ""
"Cleaner: CommandLine supports enum and other types directly, meaning that"
" there is less error and more security built into the library.  You don't"
" have to worry about whether your integral command line argument "
"accidentally got assigned a value that is not valid for your enum type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:50
msgid ""
"Powerful: The CommandLine library supports many different types of "
"arguments, from simple `boolean flags`_ to `scalars arguments`_ "
"(`strings`_, `integers`_, `enums`_, `doubles`_), to `lists of "
"arguments`_.  This is possible because CommandLine is..."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:55
msgid ""
"Extensible: It is very simple to add a new argument type to CommandLine. "
"Simply specify the parser that you want to use with the command line "
"option when you declare it. `Custom parsers`_ are no problem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:59
msgid ""
"Labor Saving: The CommandLine library cuts down on the amount of grunt "
"work that you, the user, have to do.  For example, it automatically "
"provides a ``-help`` option that shows the available command line options"
" for your tool. Additionally, it does most of the basic correctness "
"checking for you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:64
msgid ""
"Capable: The CommandLine library can handle lots of different forms of "
"options often found in real programs.  For example, `positional`_ "
"arguments, ``ls`` style `grouping`_ options (to allow processing '``ls "
"-lad``' naturally), ``ld`` style `prefix`_ options (to parse '``-lmalloc "
"-L/usr/lib``'), and interpreter style options."

"This document will hopefully let you jump in and start using CommandLine "
"in your utility quickly and painlessly.  Additionally it should be a "

"This section of the manual runs through a simple CommandLine'ification of"
" a basic compiler tool.  This is intended to show you how to jump into "
"using the CommandLine library in your own program, and show you some of "
"the cool things it can do."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:82
msgid ""
"To start out, you need to include the CommandLine header file into your "
"program:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:88
msgid "Additionally, you need to add this as the first line of your main program:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:97
msgid ""
"... which actually parses the arguments and fills in the variable "
"declarations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:99
msgid ""
"Now that you are ready to support command line arguments, we need to tell"
" the system which ones we want, and what type of arguments they are.  The"
" CommandLine library uses a declarative syntax to model command line "
"arguments with the global variable declarations that capture the parsed "
"values.  This means that for every command line option that you would "
"like to support, there should be a global variable declaration to capture"
" the result.  For example, in a compiler, we would like to support the "
"Unix-standard '``-o <filename>``' option to specify where to put the "
"output.  With the CommandLine library, this is represented like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:116
msgid ""
"This declares a global variable \"``OutputFilename``\" that is used to "
"capture the result of the \"``o``\" argument (first parameter).  We "
"specify that this is a simple scalar option by using the \"``cl::opt``\" "
"template (as opposed to the \"``cl::list``\" template), and tell the "
"CommandLine library that the data type that we are parsing is a string."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:122
msgid ""
"The second and third parameters (which are optional) are used to specify "
"what to output for the \"``-help``\" option.  In this case, we get a line"
" that looks like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:134
msgid ""
"Because we specified that the command line option should parse using the "
"``string`` data type, the variable declared is automatically usable as a "
"real string in all contexts that a normal C++ string object may be used."
"  For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:146
msgid ""
"There are many different options that you can use to customize the "
"command line option handling library, but the above example shows the "
"general interface to these options.  The options can be specified in any "
"order, and are specified with helper functions like `cl::desc(...)`_, so "
"there are no positional dependencies to remember.  The available options "
"are discussed in detail in the `Reference Guide`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:153
msgid ""
"Continuing the example, we would like to have our compiler take an input "
"filename as well as an output filename, but we do not want the input "
"filename to be specified with a hyphen (ie, not ``-filename.c``).  To "
"support this style of argument, the CommandLine library allows for "
"`positional`_ arguments to be specified for the program.  These "
"positional arguments are filled with command line parameters that are not"
" in option form.  We use this feature like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:165
msgid ""
"This declaration indicates that the first positional argument should be "
"treated as the input filename.  Here we use the `cl::init`_ option to "
"specify an initial value for the command line option, which is used if "
"the option is not specified (if you do not specify a `cl::init`_ modifier"
" for an option, then the default constructor for the data type is used to"
" initialize the value).  Command line options default to being optional, "
"so if we would like to require that the user always specify an input "
"filename, we would add the `cl::Required`_ flag, and we could eliminate "
"the `cl::init`_ modifier, like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:178
msgid ""
"Again, the CommandLine library does not require the options to be "
"specified in any particular order, so the above declaration is equivalent"
" to:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:185
msgid ""
"By simply adding the `cl::Required`_ flag, the CommandLine library will "
"automatically issue an error if the argument is not specified, which "
"shifts all of the command line option verification code out of your "
"application into the library.  This is just one example of how using "
"flags can alter the default behaviour of the library, on a per-option "
"basis.  By adding one of the declarations above, the ``-help`` option "
"synopsis is now extended to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "... indicating that an input filename is expected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:203
msgid "Boolean Arguments"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:205
msgid ""
"In addition to input and output filenames, we would like the compiler "
"example to support three boolean flags: \"``-f``\" to force writing "
"binary output to a terminal, \"``--quiet``\" to enable quiet mode, and "
"\"``-q``\" for backwards compatibility with some of our users.  We can "
"support these by declaring options of boolean type like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:217
msgid ""
"This does what you would expect: it declares three boolean variables "
"(\"``Force``\", \"``Quiet``\", and \"``Quiet2``\") to recognize these "
"options.  Note that the \"``-q``\" option is specified with the "
"\"`cl::Hidden`_\" flag.  This modifier prevents it from being shown by "
"the standard \"``-help``\" output (note that it is still shown in the "
"\"``-help-hidden``\" output)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:223
msgid ""
"The CommandLine library uses a `different parser`_ for different data "
"types. For example, in the string case, the argument passed to the option"
" is copied literally into the content of the string variable... we "
"obviously cannot do that in the boolean case, however, so we must use a "
"smarter parser.  In the case of the boolean parser, it allows no options "
"(in which case it assigns the value of true to the variable), or it "
"allows the values \"``true``\" or \"``false``\" to be specified, allowing"
" any of the following inputs:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:238
msgid ""
"... you get the idea.  The `bool parser`_ just turns the string values "
"into boolean values, and rejects things like '``compiler -f=foo``'.  "
"Similarly, the `float`_, `double`_, and `int`_ parsers work like you "
"would expect, using the '``strtol``' and '``strtod``' C library calls to "
"parse the string value into the specified data type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This brief example has shown you how to use the '`cl::opt`_' class to "
"parse simple scalar command line arguments.  In addition to simple scalar"

msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:277
msgid "Argument Aliases"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:279
msgid ""
"So far, the example works well, except for the fact that we need to check"
" the quiet condition like this now:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:288
msgid ""
"... which is a real pain!  Instead of defining two values for the same "
"condition, we can use the \"`cl::alias`_\" class to make the \"``-q``\" "
"option an **alias** for the \"``-quiet``\" option, instead of providing a"
" value itself:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:298
msgid ""
"The third line (which is the only one we modified from above) defines a "
"\"``-q``\" alias that updates the \"``Quiet``\" variable (as specified by"
" the `cl::aliasopt`_ modifier) whenever it is specified.  Because aliases"
" do not hold state, the only thing the program has to query is the "
"``Quiet`` variable now.  Another nice feature of aliases is that they "
"automatically hide themselves from the ``-help`` output (although, again,"
" they are still visible in the ``-help-hidden output``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:305
msgid "Now the application code can simply use:"
msgstr ""

" it doesn't know about, like enums or '``int*``'s?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:325
msgid ""
"The answer is that it uses a table-driven generic parser (unless you "
"specify your own parser, as described in the `Extension Guide`_).  This "
"parser maps literal strings to whatever type is required, and requires "
"you to tell it what this mapping should be."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's say that we would like to add four optimization levels to our "
"optimizer, using the standard flags \"``-g``\", \"``-O0``\", \"``-O1``\","
" and \"``-O2``\".  We could easily implement this with boolean options "
"like above, but there are several problems with this strategy:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:335
msgid ""
"A user could specify more than one of the options at a time, for example,"

"To cope with these problems, we can use an enum value, and have the "

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:365
msgid ""
"This declaration defines a variable \"``OptimizationLevel``\" of the "
"\"``OptLevel``\" enum type.  This variable can be assigned any of the "

"CommandLine library enforces that the user can only specify one of the "

" \"``clEnumVal``\" macros ensure that the command line arguments matched "
"the enum values.  With this option added, our help output now is:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:389
msgid ""
"In this case, it is sort of awkward that flag names correspond directly "

"\"``g``\" in our program.  Because of this, we can alternatively write "
"this example like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:411
msgid ""
"By using the \"``clEnumValN``\" macro instead of \"``clEnumVal``\", we "

" the mapping, which is when you would use it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:417
msgid "Named Alternatives"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:419
msgid ""
"Another useful argument form is a named alternative style.  We shall use "
"this style in our compiler to specify different debug levels that can be "

"support the following options, of which only one can be specified at a "
"time: \"``--debug-level=none``\", \"``--debug-level=quick``\", "
"\"``--debug-level=detailed``\".  To do this, we use the exact same format"
" as our optimization level flags, but we also specify an option name.  "
"For this case, the code looks like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:442
msgid ""
"This definition defines an enumerated command line variable of type "
"\"``enum DebugLev``\", which works exactly the same way as before.  The "

" and the help output by the \"``-help``\" option:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CommandLine.rst:466
msgid ""
"Again, the only structural difference between the debug level declaration"
" and the optimization level declaration is that the debug level "
"declaration includes an option name (``\"debug_level\"``), which "

"Now that we have the standard run-of-the-mill argument types out of the "

msgid ""
"Note that the \"``cl::list``\" template is completely general and may be "

msgid ""
"This variable works just like a \"``vector<string>``\" object.  As such, "

"Sometimes an option can affect or modify the meaning of another option. "
