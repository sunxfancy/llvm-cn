"Welcome to LLVM on Windows! This document only covers LLVM on Windows "

"There are many different projects that compose LLVM. The first piece is "
"the LLVM suite. This contains all of the tools, libraries, and header "
"files needed to use LLVM. It contains an assembler, disassembler, bitcode"
" analyzer and bitcode optimizer. It also contains basic regression tests "
"that can be used to test the LLVM tools and the Clang front end."
msgstr ""

#: ../../GettingStartedVS.rst:21
msgid ""
"The second piece is the `Clang <http://clang.llvm.org/>`_ front end.  "
"This component compiles C, C++, Objective C, and Objective C++ code into "
"LLVM bitcode. Clang typically uses LLVM libraries to optimize the bitcode"
" and emit machine code. LLVM fully supports the COFF object file format, "
"which is compatible with all other existing Windows toolchains."
