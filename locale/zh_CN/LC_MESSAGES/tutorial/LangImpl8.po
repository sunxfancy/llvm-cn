"Welcome to Chapter 8 of the \"`Implementing a language with LLVM "
"<index.html>`_\" tutorial. In chapters 1 through 7, we've built a decent "
"little programming language with functions and variables. What happens if"
" something goes wrong though, how do you debug your program?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:17
msgid ""
"Source level debugging uses formatted data that helps a debugger "
"translate from binary and the state of the machine back to the source "
"that the programmer wrote. In LLVM we generally use a format called "
"`DWARF <http://dwarfstd.org>`_. DWARF is a compact encoding that "
"represents types, source locations, and variable locations."

"The short summary of this chapter is that we'll go through the various "
"things you have to add to a programming language to support debug info, "
"and how you translate that into DWARF."

msgid ""
"Caveat: For now we can't debug via the JIT, so we'll need to compile our "
"program down to something small and standalone. As part of this we'll "
"make a few modifications to the running of the language and how programs "
"are compiled. This means that we'll have a source file with a simple "
"program written in Kaleidoscope rather than the interactive JIT. It does "
"involve a limitation that we can only have one \"top level\" command at a"
" time to reduce the number of changes necessary."

msgid "Why is this a hard problem?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:52
msgid ""
"Debug information is a hard problem for a few different reasons - mostly "
"centered around optimized code. First, optimization makes keeping source "
"locations more difficult. In LLVM IR we keep the original source location"
" for each IR level instruction on the instruction. Optimization passes "
"should keep the source locations for newly created instructions, but "
"merged instructions only get to keep a single location - this can cause "
"jumping around when stepping through optimized programs. Secondly, "
"optimization can move variables in ways that are either optimized out, "
"shared in memory with other variables, or difficult to track. For the "
"purposes of this tutorial we're going to avoid optimization (as you'll "
"see with one of the next sets of patches)."

"To highlight only the aspects of adding debug information to a source "
"language without needing to worry about the complexities of JIT debugging"

"the IR emitted by the front end into a simple standalone program that you"
" can execute, debug, and see results."

"Lastly we're going to disable all of the optimization passes and the JIT "

msgid ""
"The top level container for a section of code in DWARF is a compile unit."
" This contains the type and function data for an individual translation "

"Similar to the ``IRBuilder`` class we have a `DIBuilder "
"<http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1DIBuilder.html>`_ class that helps "
"in constructing debug metadata for an llvm IR file. It corresponds 1:1 "
"similarly to ``IRBuilder`` and llvm IR, but with nicer names. Using it "
"does require that you be more familiar with DWARF terminology than you "
"needed to be with ``IRBuilder`` and ``Instruction`` names, but if you "
"read through the general documentation on the `Metadata Format "
"<http://llvm.org/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html>`_ it should be a little "
"more clear. We'll be using this class to construct all of our IR level "
"descriptions. Construction for it takes a module so we need to construct "
"it shortly after we construct our module. We've left it as a global "
"static variable to make it a bit easier to use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:180
msgid ""
"Next we're going to create a small container to cache some of our "
"frequent data. The first will be our compile unit, but we'll also write a"
" bit of code for our one type since we won't have to worry about multiple"
" typed expressions:"

msgid ""
"There are a couple of things to note here. First, while we're producing a"
" compile unit for a language called Kaleidoscope we used the language "
"constant for C. This is because a debugger wouldn't necessarily "
"understand the calling conventions or default ABI for a language it "
"doesn't recognize and we follow the C ABI in our llvm code generation so "
"it's the closest thing to accurate. This ensures we can actually call "
"functions from the debugger and have them execute. Secondly, you'll see "
"the \"fib.ks\" in the call to ``createCompileUnit``. This is a default "
"hard coded value since we're using shell redirection to put our source "
"into the Kaleidoscope compiler. In a usual front end you'd have an input "
"file name and it would go there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:225
msgid ""
"One last thing as part of emitting debug information via DIBuilder is "
"that we need to \"finalize\" the debug information. The reasons are part "
"of the underlying API for DIBuilder, but make sure you do this near the "
"end of main:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:234
msgid "before you dump out the module."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:237
msgid "Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:239
msgid ""
"Now that we have our ``Compile Unit`` and our source locations, we can "
"add function definitions to the debug info. So in "
"``PrototypeAST::codegen()`` we add a few lines of code to describe a "
"context for our subprogram, in this case the \"File\", and the actual "
"definition of the function itself."

"giving us an DIFile and asking the ``Compile Unit`` we created above for "
"the directory and filename where we are currently. Then, for now, we use "
"some source locations of 0 (since our AST doesn't currently have source "
"location information) and construct our function definition:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:267
msgid ""
"and we now have an DISubprogram that contains a reference to all of our "
"metadata for the function."

msgid "Source Locations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:273
msgid ""
"The most important thing for debug information is accurate source "
"location - this makes it possible to map your source code back. We have a"
" problem though, Kaleidoscope really doesn't have any source location "
"information in the lexer or parser so we'll need to add it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:298
msgid ""
"In this set of code we've added some functionality on how to keep track "
"of the line and column of the \"source file\". As we lex every token we "
"set our current current \"lexical location\" to the assorted line and "
"column for the beginning of the token. We do this by overriding all of "
"the previous calls to ``getchar()`` with our new ``advance()`` that keeps"
" track of the information and then we have added to all of our AST "
"classes a source location:"

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:320

msgid ""
"From this we can make sure to tell ``DIBuilder`` when we're at a new "
"source location so it can use that when we generate the rest of our code "
"and make sure that each instruction has source location information. We "
"do this by constructing another small function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:346
msgid ""
"that both tells the main ``IRBuilder`` where we are, but also what scope "
"we're in. Since we've just created a function above we can either be in "
"the main file scope (like when we created our function), or now we can be"
" in the function scope we just created. To represent this we create a "
"stack of scopes:"
msgstr ""

"Now that we have functions, we need to be able to print out the variables"
" we have in scope. Let's get our function arguments set up so we can get "
"decent backtraces and see how our functions are being called. It isn't a "
"lot of code, and we generally handle it when we're creating the argument "
"allocas in ``PrototypeAST::CreateArgumentAllocas``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:409
msgid ""
"Here we're doing a few things. First, we're grabbing our current scope "
"for the variable so we can say what range of code our variable is valid "
"through. Second, we're creating the variable, giving it the scope, the "
"name, source location, type, and since it's an argument, the argument "
"index. Third, we create an ``lvm.dbg.declare`` call to indicate at the IR"
" level that we've got a variable in an alloca (and it gives a starting "
"location for the variable), and setting a source location for the "
"beginning of the scope on the declare."

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl8.rst:418
msgid ""
"One interesting thing to note at this point is that various debuggers "
"have assumptions based on how code and debug information was generated "
"for them in the past. In this case we need to do a little bit of a hack "
"to avoid generating line information for the function prologue so that "
"the debugger knows to skip over those instructions when setting a "
"breakpoint. So in ``FunctionAST::CodeGen`` we add a couple of lines:"
