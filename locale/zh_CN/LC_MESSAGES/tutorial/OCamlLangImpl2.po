"Welcome to Chapter 2 of the \"`Implementing a language with LLVM in "

"use the lexer, built in `Chapter 1 <OCamlLangImpl1.html>`_, to build a "
"full `parser <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing>`_ for our "
"Kaleidoscope language. Once we have a parser, we'll define and build an "

"The AST for a program captures its behavior in such a way that it is easy"
" for later stages of the compiler (e.g. code generation) to interpret. We"
" basically want one object for each construct in the language, and the "
"AST should closely model the language. In Kaleidoscope, we have "
"expressions, a prototype, and a function object. We'll start with "
"expressions first:"

"The code above shows the definition of the base ExprAST class and one "
"subclass which we use for numeric literals. The important thing to note "

"compiler to know what the stored numeric value is."

"Right now we only create the AST, so there are no useful functions on "

"This is all (intentionally) rather straight-forward: variables capture "
"the variable name, binary operators capture their opcode (e.g. '+'), and "
"calls capture a function name as well as a list of any argument "
"expressions. One thing that is nice about our AST is that it captures the"
" language features without talking about the syntax of the language. Note"

"lexical structure, etc."

"Now that we have an AST to build, we need to define the parser code to "

"(which is returned as three tokens by the lexer) into an AST that could "
"be generated with calls like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The error handling routines make use of the builtin ``Stream.Failure`` "
"and ``Stream.Error``s. ``Stream.Failure`` is raised when the parser is "
"unable to find any matching token in the first position of a pattern. "
"``Stream.Error`` is raised when the first token matches, but the rest do "
"not. The error recovery in our parser will not be the best and is not "

"We start with numeric literals, because they are the simplest to process."
" For each production in our grammar, we'll define a function which parses"
" that production. We call this class of expressions \"primary\" "
"expressions, for reasons that will become more clear `later in the "
"tutorial <OCamlLangImpl6.html#user-defined-unary-operators>`_. In order "
"to parse an arbitrary primary expression, we need to determine what sort "
"of expression it is. For numeric literals, we have:"

"This routine is very simple: it expects to be called when the current "
"token is a ``Token.Number`` token. It takes the current number value, "
"creates a ``Ast.Number`` node, advances the lexer to the next token, and "
"finally returns."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:152
msgid ""
"There are some interesting aspects to this. The most important one is "
"that this routine eats all of the tokens that correspond to the "
"production and returns the lexer buffer with the next token (which is not"
" part of the grammar production) ready to go. This is a fairly standard "
"way to go for recursive descent parsers. For a better example, the "
"parenthesis operator is defined like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:164
msgid "This function illustrates a number of interesting things about the parser:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:167
msgid ""
"1) It shows how we use the ``Stream.Error`` exception. When called, this "
"function expects that the current token is a '(' token, but after parsing"
" the subexpression, it is possible that there is no ')' waiting. For "
"example, if the user types in \"(4 x\" instead of \"(4)\", the parser "
"should emit an error. Because errors can occur, the parser needs a way to"
" indicate that they happened. In our parser, we use the camlp4 shortcut "
"syntax ``token ?? \"parse error\"``, where if the token before the ``??``"
" does not match, then ``Stream.Error \"parse error\"`` will be raised."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:177
msgid ""
"2) Another interesting aspect of this function is that it uses recursion "
"by calling ``Parser.parse_primary`` (we will soon see that "
"``Parser.parse_primary`` can call ``Parser.parse_primary``). This is "
"powerful because it allows us to handle recursive grammars, and keeps "
"each production very simple. Note that parentheses do not cause "
"construction of AST nodes themselves. While we could do it this way, the "
"most important role of parentheses are to guide the parser and provide "
"grouping. Once the parser constructs the AST, parentheses are not needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:187
msgid ""
"The next simple production is for handling variable references and "
"function calls:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:216
msgid ""
"This routine follows the same style as the other routines. (It expects to"
" be called if the current token is a ``Token.Ident`` token). It also has "
"recursion and error handling. One interesting aspect of this is that it "
"uses *look-ahead* to determine if the current identifier is a stand alone"
" variable reference or if it is a function call expression. It handles "
"this by checking to see if the token after the identifier is a '(' token,"
" constructing either a ``Ast.Variable`` or ``Ast.Call`` node as "
"appropriate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:225
msgid ""
"We finish up by raising an exception if we received a token we didn't "
"expect:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:232
msgid ""
"Now that basic expressions are handled, we need to handle binary "
"expressions. They are a bit more complex."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:236
msgid "Binary Expression Parsing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:238
msgid ""
"Binary expressions are significantly harder to parse because they are "
"often ambiguous. For example, when given the string \"x+y\\*z\", the "
"parser can choose to parse it as either \"(x+y)\\*z\" or \"x+(y\\*z)\". "
"With common definitions from mathematics, we expect the later parse, "
"because \"\\*\" (multiplication) has higher *precedence* than \"+\" "
"(addition)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:244
msgid ""
"There are many ways to handle this, but an elegant and efficient way is "
"to use `Operator-Precedence Parsing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki"
"/Operator-precedence_parser>`_. This parsing technique uses the "
"precedence of binary operators to guide recursion. To start with, we need"
" a table of precedences:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:270
msgid ""
"For the basic form of Kaleidoscope, we will only support 4 binary "
"operators (this can obviously be extended by you, our brave and intrepid "
"reader). The ``Parser.precedence`` function returns the precedence for "
"the current token, or -1 if the token is not a binary operator. Having a "
"``Hashtbl.t`` makes it easy to add new operators and makes it clear that "
"the algorithm doesn't depend on the specific operators involved, but it "
"would be easy enough to eliminate the ``Hashtbl.t`` and do the "
"comparisons in the ``Parser.precedence`` function. (Or just use a fixed-"
"size array)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:280
msgid ""
"With the helper above defined, we can now start parsing binary "
"expressions. The basic idea of operator precedence parsing is to break "
"down an expression with potentially ambiguous binary operators into "
"pieces. Consider, for example, the expression \"a+b+(c+d)\\*e\\*f+g\". "
"Operator precedence parsing considers this as a stream of primary "
"expressions separated by binary operators. As such, it will first parse "
"the leading primary expression \"a\", then it will see the pairs [+, b] "
"[+, (c+d)] [\\*, e] [\\*, f] and [+, g]. Note that because parentheses "
"are primary expressions, the binary expression parser doesn't need to "
"worry about nested subexpressions like (c+d) at all."

"To start, an expression is a primary expression potentially followed by a"
" sequence of [binop,primaryexpr] pairs:"

msgid ""
"``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` is the function that parses the sequence of "
"pairs for us. It takes a precedence and a pointer to an expression for "
"the part that has been parsed so far. Note that \"x\" is a perfectly "
"valid expression: As such, \"binoprhs\" is allowed to be empty, in which "
"case it returns the expression that is passed into it. In our example "
"above, the code passes the expression for \"a\" into "
"``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` and the current token is \"+\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:309
msgid ""
"The precedence value passed into ``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` indicates the "
"*minimal operator precedence* that the function is allowed to eat. For "
"example, if the current pair stream is [+, x] and "
"``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` is passed in a precedence of 40, it will not "
"consume any tokens (because the precedence of '+' is only 20). With this "
"in mind, ``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` starts with:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:330
msgid ""
"This code gets the precedence of the current token and checks to see if "
"if is too low. Because we defined invalid tokens to have a precedence of "
"-1, this check implicitly knows that the pair-stream ends when the token "
"stream runs out of binary operators. If this check succeeds, we know that"
" the token is a binary operator and that it will be included in this "
"expression:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:350
msgid ""
"As such, this code eats (and remembers) the binary operator and then "
"parses the primary expression that follows. This builds up the whole "
"pair, the first of which is [+, b] for the running example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:354
msgid ""
"Now that we parsed the left-hand side of an expression and one pair of "
"the RHS sequence, we have to decide which way the expression associates. "
"In particular, we could have \"(a+b) binop unparsed\" or \"a + (b binop "
"unparsed)\". To determine this, we look ahead at \"binop\" to determine "
"its precedence and compare it to BinOp's precedence (which is '+' in this"
" case):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:368
msgid ""
"If the precedence of the binop to the right of \"RHS\" is lower or equal "
"to the precedence of our current operator, then we know that the "
"parentheses associate as \"(a+b) binop ...\". In our example, the current"
" operator is \"+\" and the next operator is \"+\", we know that they have"
" the same precedence. In this case we'll create the AST node for \"a+b\","
" and then continue parsing:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:385
msgid ""
"In our example above, this will turn \"a+b+\" into \"(a+b)\" and execute "
"the next iteration of the loop, with \"+\" as the current token. The code"
" above will eat, remember, and parse \"(c+d)\" as the primary expression,"
" which makes the current pair equal to [+, (c+d)]. It will then evaluate "
"the 'if' conditional above with \"\\*\" as the binop to the right of the "
"primary. In this case, the precedence of \"\\*\" is higher than the "
"precedence of \"+\" so the if condition will be entered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:393
msgid ""
"The critical question left here is \"how can the if condition parse the "
"right hand side in full\"? In particular, to build the AST correctly for "
"our example, it needs to get all of \"(c+d)\\*e\\*f\" as the RHS "
"expression variable. The code to do this is surprisingly simple (code "
"from the above two blocks duplicated for context):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:416
msgid ""
"At this point, we know that the binary operator to the RHS of our primary"
" has higher precedence than the binop we are currently parsing. As such, "
"we know that any sequence of pairs whose operators are all higher "
"precedence than \"+\" should be parsed together and returned as \"RHS\". "
"To do this, we recursively invoke the ``Parser.parse_bin_rhs`` function "
"specifying \"token\\_prec+1\" as the minimum precedence required for it "
"to continue. In our example above, this will cause it to return the AST "
"node for \"(c+d)\\*e\\*f\" as RHS, which is then set as the RHS of the "
"'+' expression."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl2.rst:426
msgid ""
"Finally, on the next iteration of the while loop, the \"+g\" piece is "
"parsed and added to the AST. With this little bit of code (14 non-trivial"
" lines), we correctly handle fully general binary expression parsing in a"
" very elegant way. This was a whirlwind tour of this code, and it is "
"somewhat subtle. I recommend running through it with a few tough examples"
" to see how it works."

"This wraps up handling of expressions. At this point, we can point the "

"The next thing missing is handling of function prototypes. In "
