"Welcome to Chapter 5 of the \"`Implementing a language with LLVM "
"<index.html>`_\" tutorial. Parts 1-4 described the implementation of the "
"simple Kaleidoscope language and included support for generating LLVM IR,"
" followed by optimizations and a JIT compiler. Unfortunately, as "
"presented, Kaleidoscope is mostly useless: it has no control flow other "
"than call and return. This means that you can't have conditional branches"
" in the code, significantly limiting its power. In this episode of "
"\"build that compiler\", we'll extend Kaleidoscope to have an "
"if/then/else expression plus a simple 'for' loop."

"Extending Kaleidoscope to support if/then/else is quite straightforward. "
"It basically requires adding support for this \"new\" concept to the "
"lexer, parser, AST, and LLVM code emitter. This example is nice, because "
"it shows how easy it is to \"grow\" a language over time, incrementally "
"extending it as new ideas are discovered."

"In Kaleidoscope, every construct is an expression: there are no "
"statements. As such, the if/then/else expression needs to return a value "
"like any other. Since we're using a mostly functional form, we'll have it"
" evaluate its conditional, then return the 'then' or 'else' value based "
"on how the condition was resolved. This is very similar to the C \"?:\" "
"expression."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl5.rst:49
msgid ""
"The semantics of the if/then/else expression is that it evaluates the "
"condition to a boolean equality value: 0.0 is considered to be false and "
"everything else is considered to be true. If the condition is true, the "
"first subexpression is evaluated and returned, if the condition is false,"
" the second subexpression is evaluated and returned. Since Kaleidoscope "
"allows side-effects, this behavior is important to nail down."

"Getting back to the generated code, it is fairly simple: the entry block "

" your favorite search engine. The short version is that \"execution\" of "
"the Phi operation requires \"remembering\" which block control came from."
" The Phi operation takes on the value corresponding to the input control "

"This code creates the basic blocks that are related to the if/then/else "

"Once it has that, it creates three blocks. Note that it passes "

"inserted into the function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl5.rst:327
msgid ""
"Once the blocks are created, we can emit the conditional branch that "

"condition went into. Also note that it is creating a branch to the "
"\"then\" block and the \"else\" block, even though the \"else\" block "
"isn't inserted into the function yet. This is all ok: it is the standard "
"way that LLVM supports forward references."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl5.rst:348
msgid ""
"After the conditional branch is inserted, we move the builder to start "
"inserting into the \"then\" block. Strictly speaking, this call moves the"

"beginning of the block. :)"

msgid ""
"Once the insertion point is set, we recursively codegen the \"then\" "
"expression from the AST. To finish off the \"then\" block, we create an "
"unconditional branch to the merge block. One interesting (and very "
"important) aspect of the LLVM IR is that it `requires all basic blocks to"
" be \"terminated\" <../LangRef.html#functionstructure>`_ with a `control "
"flow instruction <../LangRef.html#terminators>`_ such as return or "
"branch. This means that all control flow, *including fall throughs* must "
"be made explicit in the LLVM IR. If you violate this rule, the verifier "
"will emit an error."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl5.rst:364
msgid ""
"The final line here is quite subtle, but is very important. The basic "
"issue is that when we create the Phi node in the merge block, we need to "
"set up the block/value pairs that indicate how the Phi will work. "
"Importantly, the Phi node expects to have an entry for each predecessor "
"of the block in the CFG. Why then, are we getting the current block when "
"we just set it to ThenBB 5 lines above? The problem is that the \"Then\" "
"expression may actually itself change the block that the Builder is "
"emitting into if, for example, it contains a nested \"if/then/else\" "
"expression. Because calling ``codegen()`` recursively could arbitrarily "
"change the notion of the current block, we are required to get an up-to-"
"date value for code that will set up the Phi node."

"Code generation for the 'else' block is basically identical to codegen "
"for the 'then' block. The only significant difference is the first line, "
"which adds the 'else' block to the function. Recall previously that the "
"'else' block was created, but not added to the function. Now that the "
"'then' and 'else' blocks are emitted, we can finish up with the merge "
"code:"

msgid ""
"The first two lines here are now familiar: the first adds the \"merge\" "
"block to the Function object (it was previously floating, like the else "
"block above). The second changes the insertion point so that newly "
"created code will go into the \"merge\" block. Once that is done, we need"
" to create the PHI node and set up the block/value pairs for the PHI."

"Finally, the CodeGen function returns the phi node as the value computed "

"With this out of the way, the next step is to set up the LLVM basic block"
" for the start of the loop body. In the case above, the whole loop body "

"Now that the \"preheader\" for the loop is set up, we switch to emitting "
