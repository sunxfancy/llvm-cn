"Welcome to Chapter 2 of the \"`Implementing a language with LLVM "

"built in `Chapter 1 <LangImpl1.html>`_, to build a full `parser "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing>`_ for our Kaleidoscope language. "

"The AST for a program captures its behavior in such a way that it is easy"
" for later stages of the compiler (e.g. code generation) to interpret. We"
" basically want one object for each construct in the language, and the "
"AST should closely model the language. In Kaleidoscope, we have "
"expressions, a prototype, and a function object. We'll start with "
"expressions first:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:52

"The code above shows the definition of the base ExprAST class and one "
"subclass which we use for numeric literals. The important thing to note "
"about this code is that the NumberExprAST class captures the numeric "
"value of the literal as an instance variable. This allows later phases of"
" the compiler to know what the stored numeric value is."
msgstr ""

"Right now we only create the AST, so there are no useful accessor methods"
" on them. It would be very easy to add a virtual method to pretty print "

" that we'll use in the basic form of the Kaleidoscope language:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:96
msgid ""
"This is all (intentionally) rather straight-forward: variables capture "
"the variable name, binary operators capture their opcode (e.g. '+'), and "
"calls capture a function name as well as a list of any argument "
"expressions. One thing that is nice about our AST is that it captures the"
" language features without talking about the syntax of the language. Note"
" that there is no discussion about precedence of binary operators, "
"lexical structure, etc."

"For our basic language, these are all of the expression nodes we'll "

"Now that we have an AST to build, we need to define the parser code to "
"build it. The idea here is that we want to parse something like \"x+y\" "
"(which is returned as three tokens by the lexer) into an AST that could "
"be generated with calls like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:159
msgid "In order to do this, we'll start by defining some basic helper routines:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:171
msgid ""
"This implements a simple token buffer around the lexer. This allows us to"
" look one token ahead at what the lexer is returning. Every function in "
"our parser will assume that CurTok is the current token that needs to be "
"parsed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:189
msgid ""
"The ``Error`` routines are simple helper routines that our parser will "
"use to handle errors. The error recovery in our parser will not be the "
"best and is not particular user-friendly, but it will be enough for our "
"tutorial. These routines make it easier to handle errors in routines that"
" have various return types: they always return null."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:195
msgid ""
"With these basic helper functions, we can implement the first piece of "
"our grammar: numeric literals."

msgid ""
"We start with numeric literals, because they are the simplest to process."
" For each production in our grammar, we'll define a function which parses"
" that production. For numeric literals, we have:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:214
msgid ""
"This routine is very simple: it expects to be called when the current "
"token is a ``tok_number`` token. It takes the current number value, "
"creates a ``NumberExprAST`` node, advances the lexer to the next token, "
"and finally returns."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:219
msgid ""
"There are some interesting aspects to this. The most important one is "
"that this routine eats all of the tokens that correspond to the "
"production and returns the lexer buffer with the next token (which is not"
" part of the grammar production) ready to go. This is a fairly standard "
"way to go for recursive descent parsers. For a better example, the "
"parenthesis operator is defined like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:241
msgid "This function illustrates a number of interesting things about the parser:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:244
msgid ""
"1) It shows how we use the Error routines. When called, this function "
"expects that the current token is a '(' token, but after parsing the "
"subexpression, it is possible that there is no ')' waiting. For example, "
"if the user types in \"(4 x\" instead of \"(4)\", the parser should emit "
"an error. Because errors can occur, the parser needs a way to indicate "
"that they happened: in our parser, we return null on an error."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:251
msgid ""
"2) Another interesting aspect of this function is that it uses recursion "
"by calling ``ParseExpression`` (we will soon see that ``ParseExpression``"
" can call ``ParseParenExpr``). This is powerful because it allows us to "
"handle recursive grammars, and keeps each production very simple. Note "
"that parentheses do not cause construction of AST nodes themselves. While"
" we could do it this way, the most important role of parentheses are to "
"guide the parser and provide grouping. Once the parser constructs the "
"AST, parentheses are not needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:261
msgid ""
"The next simple production is for handling variable references and "
"function calls:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:302
msgid ""
"This routine follows the same style as the other routines. (It expects to"
" be called if the current token is a ``tok_identifier`` token). It also "
"has recursion and error handling. One interesting aspect of this is that "
"it uses *look-ahead* to determine if the current identifier is a stand "
"alone variable reference or if it is a function call expression. It "
"handles this by checking to see if the token after the identifier is a "
"'(' token, constructing either a ``VariableExprAST`` or ``CallExprAST`` "
"node as appropriate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:311
msgid ""
"Now that we have all of our simple expression-parsing logic in place, we "
"can define a helper function to wrap it together into one entry point. We"
" call this class of expressions \"primary\" expressions, for reasons that"
" will become more clear `later in the tutorial <LangImpl6.html#user-"
"defined-unary-operators>`_. In order to parse an arbitrary primary "
"expression, we need to determine what sort of expression it is:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:337
msgid ""
"Now that you see the definition of this function, it is more obvious why "
"we can assume the state of CurTok in the various functions. This uses "
"look-ahead to determine which sort of expression is being inspected, and "
"then parses it with a function call."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:342
msgid ""
"Now that basic expressions are handled, we need to handle binary "
"expressions. They are a bit more complex."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:346
msgid "Binary Expression Parsing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:348
msgid ""
"Binary expressions are significantly harder to parse because they are "
"often ambiguous. For example, when given the string \"x+y\\*z\", the "
"parser can choose to parse it as either \"(x+y)\\*z\" or \"x+(y\\*z)\". "
"With common definitions from mathematics, we expect the later parse, "
"because \"\\*\" (multiplication) has higher *precedence* than \"+\" "
"(addition)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:354
msgid ""
"There are many ways to handle this, but an elegant and efficient way is "
"to use `Operator-Precedence Parsing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki"
"/Operator-precedence_parser>`_. This parsing technique uses the "
"precedence of binary operators to guide recursion. To start with, we need"
" a table of precedences:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:387
msgid ""
"For the basic form of Kaleidoscope, we will only support 4 binary "
"operators (this can obviously be extended by you, our brave and intrepid "
"reader). The ``GetTokPrecedence`` function returns the precedence for the"
" current token, or -1 if the token is not a binary operator. Having a map"
" makes it easy to add new operators and makes it clear that the algorithm"
" doesn't depend on the specific operators involved, but it would be easy "
"enough to eliminate the map and do the comparisons in the "
"``GetTokPrecedence`` function. (Or just use a fixed-size array)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:396
msgid ""
"With the helper above defined, we can now start parsing binary "
"expressions. The basic idea of operator precedence parsing is to break "
"down an expression with potentially ambiguous binary operators into "
"pieces. Consider, for example, the expression \"a+b+(c+d)\\*e\\*f+g\". "
"Operator precedence parsing considers this as a stream of primary "
"expressions separated by binary operators. As such, it will first parse "
"the leading primary expression \"a\", then it will see the pairs [+, b] "
"[+, (c+d)] [\\*, e] [\\*, f] and [+, g]. Note that because parentheses "
"are primary expressions, the binary expression parser doesn't need to "
"worry about nested subexpressions like (c+d) at all."

msgid ""
"To start, an expression is a primary expression potentially followed by a"
" sequence of [binop,primaryexpr] pairs:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:423
msgid ""
"``ParseBinOpRHS`` is the function that parses the sequence of pairs for "
"us. It takes a precedence and a pointer to an expression for the part "
"that has been parsed so far. Note that \"x\" is a perfectly valid "
"expression: As such, \"binoprhs\" is allowed to be empty, in which case "
"it returns the expression that is passed into it. In our example above, "
"the code passes the expression for \"a\" into ``ParseBinOpRHS`` and the "
"current token is \"+\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:431
msgid ""
"The precedence value passed into ``ParseBinOpRHS`` indicates the *minimal"
" operator precedence* that the function is allowed to eat. For example, "
"if the current pair stream is [+, x] and ``ParseBinOpRHS`` is passed in a"
" precedence of 40, it will not consume any tokens (because the precedence"
" of '+' is only 20). With this in mind, ``ParseBinOpRHS`` starts with:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:453
msgid ""
"This code gets the precedence of the current token and checks to see if "
"if is too low. Because we defined invalid tokens to have a precedence of "
"-1, this check implicitly knows that the pair-stream ends when the token "
"stream runs out of binary operators. If this check succeeds, we know that"
" the token is a binary operator and that it will be included in this "
"expression:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:471
msgid ""
"As such, this code eats (and remembers) the binary operator and then "
"parses the primary expression that follows. This builds up the whole "
"pair, the first of which is [+, b] for the running example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:475
msgid ""
"Now that we parsed the left-hand side of an expression and one pair of "
"the RHS sequence, we have to decide which way the expression associates. "
"In particular, we could have \"(a+b) binop unparsed\" or \"a + (b binop "
"unparsed)\". To determine this, we look ahead at \"binop\" to determine "
"its precedence and compare it to BinOp's precedence (which is '+' in this"
" case):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:489
msgid ""
"If the precedence of the binop to the right of \"RHS\" is lower or equal "
"to the precedence of our current operator, then we know that the "
"parentheses associate as \"(a+b) binop ...\". In our example, the current"
" operator is \"+\" and the next operator is \"+\", we know that they have"
" the same precedence. In this case we'll create the AST node for \"a+b\","
" and then continue parsing:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:507
msgid ""
"In our example above, this will turn \"a+b+\" into \"(a+b)\" and execute "
"the next iteration of the loop, with \"+\" as the current token. The code"
" above will eat, remember, and parse \"(c+d)\" as the primary expression,"
" which makes the current pair equal to [+, (c+d)]. It will then evaluate "
"the 'if' conditional above with \"\\*\" as the binop to the right of the "
"primary. In this case, the precedence of \"\\*\" is higher than the "
"precedence of \"+\" so the if condition will be entered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:515
msgid ""
"The critical question left here is \"how can the if condition parse the "
"right hand side in full\"? In particular, to build the AST correctly for "
"our example, it needs to get all of \"(c+d)\\*e\\*f\" as the RHS "
"expression variable. The code to do this is surprisingly simple (code "
"from the above two blocks duplicated for context):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:537
msgid ""
"At this point, we know that the binary operator to the RHS of our primary"
" has higher precedence than the binop we are currently parsing. As such, "
"we know that any sequence of pairs whose operators are all higher "
"precedence than \"+\" should be parsed together and returned as \"RHS\". "
"To do this, we recursively invoke the ``ParseBinOpRHS`` function "
"specifying \"TokPrec+1\" as the minimum precedence required for it to "
"continue. In our example above, this will cause it to return the AST node"
" for \"(c+d)\\*e\\*f\" as RHS, which is then set as the RHS of the '+' "
"expression."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:547
msgid ""
"Finally, on the next iteration of the while loop, the \"+g\" piece is "
"parsed and added to the AST. With this little bit of code (14 non-trivial"
" lines), we correctly handle fully general binary expression parsing in a"
" very elegant way. This was a whirlwind tour of this code, and it is "
"somewhat subtle. I recommend running through it with a few tough examples"
" to see how it works."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/LangImpl2.rst:554

"This wraps up handling of expressions. At this point, we can point the "

"The next thing missing is handling of function prototypes. In "

"forward and not very interesting (once you've survived expressions):"

" foo...\" in which case 4+5 is the end of a top-level expression. "
