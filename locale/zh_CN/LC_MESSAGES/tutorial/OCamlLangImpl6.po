"Welcome to Chapter 6 of the \"`Implementing a language with LLVM "
"<index.html>`_\" tutorial. At this point in our tutorial, we now have a "
"fully functional language that is fairly minimal, but also useful. There "
"is still one big problem with it, however. Our language doesn't have many"
" useful operators (like division, logical negation, or even any "
"comparisons besides less-than)."

"This chapter of the tutorial takes a wild digression into adding user-"
"defined operators to the simple and beautiful Kaleidoscope language. This"
" digression now gives us a simple and ugly language in some ways, but "
"also a powerful one at the same time. One of the great things about "
"creating your own language is that you get to decide what is good or bad."
" In this tutorial we'll assume that it is okay to use this as a way to "
"show some interesting parsing techniques."

"At the end of this tutorial, we'll run through an example Kaleidoscope "

msgid ""
"The \"operator overloading\" that we will add to Kaleidoscope is more "
"general than languages like C++. In C++, you are only allowed to redefine"
" existing operators: you can't programatically change the grammar, "
"introduce new operators, change precedence levels, etc. In this chapter, "
"we will add this capability to Kaleidoscope, which will let the user "
"round out the set of operators that are supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:40
msgid ""
"The point of going into user-defined operators in a tutorial like this is"
" to show the power and flexibility of using a hand-written parser. Thus "
"far, the parser we have been implementing uses recursive descent for most"
" parts of the grammar and operator precedence parsing for the "
"expressions. See `Chapter 2 <OCamlLangImpl2.html>`_ for details. Without "
"using operator precedence parsing, it would be very difficult to allow "
"the programmer to introduce new operators into the grammar: the grammar "
"is dynamically extensible as the JIT runs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:49
msgid ""
"The two specific features we'll add are programmable unary operators "
"(right now, Kaleidoscope has no unary operators at all) as well as binary"
" operators. An example of this is:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:79
msgid ""
"Many languages aspire to being able to implement their standard runtime "
"library in the language itself. In Kaleidoscope, we can implement "
"significant parts of the language in the library!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:83
msgid ""
"We will break down implementation of these features into two parts: "
"implementing support for user-defined binary operators and adding unary "
"operators."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:88
msgid "User-defined Binary Operators"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:90
msgid ""
"Adding support for user-defined binary operators is pretty simple with "
"our current framework. We'll first add support for the unary/binary "
"keywords:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:110
msgid ""
"This just adds lexer support for the unary and binary keywords, like we "
"did in `previous chapters <OCamlLangImpl5.html#lexer-extensions-for-if-"
"then-else>`_. One nice thing about our current AST, is that we represent "
"binary operators with full generalisation by using their ASCII code as "
"the opcode. For our extended operators, we'll use this same "
"representation, so we don't need any new AST or parser support."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:117
msgid ""
"On the other hand, we have to be able to represent the definitions of "
"these new operators, in the \"def binary\\| 5\" part of the function "
"definition. In our grammar so far, the \"name\" for the function "
"definition is parsed as the \"prototype\" production and into the "
"``Ast.Prototype`` AST node. To represent our new user-defined operators "
"as prototypes, we have to extend the ``Ast.Prototype`` AST node like "
"this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:134
msgid ""
"Basically, in addition to knowing a name for the prototype, we now keep "
"track of whether it was an operator, and if it was, what precedence level"
" the operator is at. The precedence is only used for binary operators (as"
" you'll see below, it just doesn't apply for unary operators). Now that "
"we have a way to represent the prototype for a user-defined operator, we "
"need to parse it:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:188
msgid ""
"This is all fairly straightforward parsing code, and we have already seen"
" a lot of similar code in the past. One interesting part about the code "
"above is the couple lines that set up ``name`` for binary operators. This"
" builds names like \"binary@\" for a newly defined \"@\" operator. This "
"then takes advantage of the fact that symbol names in the LLVM symbol "
"table are allowed to have any character in them, including embedded nul "
"characters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:196
msgid ""
"The next interesting thing to add, is codegen support for these binary "
"operators. Given our current structure, this is a simple addition of a "
"default case for our existing binary operator node:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:228
msgid ""
"As you can see above, the new code is actually really simple. It just "
"does a lookup for the appropriate operator in the symbol table and "
"generates a function call to it. Since user-defined operators are just "
"built as normal functions (because the \"prototype\" boils down to a "
"function with the right name) everything falls into place."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:234
msgid "The final piece of code we are missing, is a bit of top level magic:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:256
msgid ""
"Basically, before codegening a function, if it is a user-defined "
"operator, we register it in the precedence table. This allows the binary "
"operator parsing logic we already have in place to handle it. Since we "
"are working on a fully-general operator precedence parser, this is all we"
" need to do to \"extend the grammar\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:262
msgid ""
"Now we have useful user-defined binary operators. This builds a lot on "
"the previous framework we built for other operators. Adding unary "
"operators is a bit more challenging, because we don't have any framework "
"for it yet - lets see what it takes."

"Since we don't currently support unary operators in the Kaleidoscope "
"language, we'll need to add everything to support them. Above, we added "
"simple support for the 'unary' keyword to the lexer. In addition to that,"
" we need an AST node:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:283
msgid ""
"This AST node is very simple and obvious by now. It directly mirrors the "
"binary operator AST node, except that it only has one child. With this, "
"we need to add the parsing logic. Parsing a unary operator is pretty "
"simple: we'll add a new function to do it:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:301
msgid ""
"The grammar we add is pretty straightforward here. If we see a unary "
"operator when parsing a primary operator, we eat the operator as a prefix"
" and parse the remaining piece as another unary operator. This allows us "
"to handle multiple unary operators (e.g. \"!!x\"). Note that unary "
"operators can't have ambiguous parses like binary operators can, so there"
" is no need for precedence information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:308
msgid ""
"The problem with this function, is that we need to call ParseUnary from "
"somewhere. To do this, we change previous callers of ParsePrimary to call"
" ``parse_unary`` instead:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:329
msgid ""
"With these two simple changes, we are now able to parse unary operators "
"and build the AST for them. Next up, we need to add parser support for "
"prototypes, to parse the unary operator prototype. We extend the binary "
"operator code above with:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:381
msgid ""
"As with binary operators, we name unary operators with a name that "
"includes the operator character. This assists us at code generation time."
" Speaking of, the final piece we need to add is codegen support for unary"
" operators. It looks like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:400
msgid ""
"This code is similar to, but simpler than, the code for binary operators."
" It is simpler primarily because it doesn't need to handle any predefined"
" operators."

"It is somewhat hard to believe, but with a few simple extensions we've "
"covered in the last chapters, we have grown a real-ish language. With "
"this, we can do a lot of interesting things, including I/O, math, and a "
"bunch of other things. For example, we can now add a nice sequencing "
"operator (printd is defined to print out the specified value and a "
"newline):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:426
msgid "We can also define a bunch of other \"primitive\" operations, such as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:465
msgid ""
"Given the previous if/then/else support, we can also define interesting "
"functions for I/O. For example, the following prints out a character "
"whose \"density\" reflects the value passed in: the lower the value, the "
"denser the character:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:490
msgid ""
"Based on these simple primitive operations, we can start to define more "
"interesting things. For example, here's a little function that solves for"
" the number of iterations it takes a function in the complex plane to "
"converge:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/OCamlLangImpl6.rst:511
msgid ""
"This \"z = z\\ :sup:`2`\\  + c\" function is a beautiful little creature "
"that is the basis for computation of the `Mandelbrot Set "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set>`_. Our ``mandelconverge`` "
"function returns the number of iterations that it takes for a complex "
"orbit to escape, saturating to 255. This is not a very useful function by"
" itself, but if you plot its value over a two-dimensional plane, you can "
"see the Mandelbrot set. Given that we are limited to using putchard here,"
" our amazing graphical output is limited, but we can whip together "
"something using the density plotter above:"

"At this point, you may be starting to realize that Kaleidoscope is a real"
" and powerful language. It may not be self-similar :), but it can be used"
" to plot things that are!"

"With this, we conclude the \"adding user-defined operators\" chapter of "
"the tutorial. We have successfully augmented our language, adding the "
"ability to extend the language in the library, and we have shown how this"
" can be used to build a simple but interesting end-user application in "
"Kaleidoscope. At this point, Kaleidoscope can build a variety of "
"applications that are functional and can call functions with side-"
"effects, but it can't actually define and mutate a variable itself."

"Strikingly, variable mutation is an important feature of some languages, "
